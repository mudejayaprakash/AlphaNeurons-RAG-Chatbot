psychological counseling, especially if there are associated

symptoms (vasovagal syncope, panic attack).

B. Aetna covers injectable medications when an appropriate oral

alternative drug does not exist. This coverage includes those

medications intended to be self-administered. The medication

must be medically necessary and appropriate to the member's

needs or condition.

II. Experimental, Investigational, or Unproven

Experimental, investigational drugs or drugs that have not been

proven safe and eﬀective for a speciﬁc disease or approved for a

mode of treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

(FDA) and/or the National Institutes of Health are not covered.

This provision does not exclude coverage of established “oﬀ label”

uses of otherwise FDA-approved prescribed medications.

III. Policy Limitations and Exclusions

A. Drugs related to the treatment of non-covered services are not

covered. Infertility injectable medications are covered only

when required by regulation or covered by a speciﬁc beneﬁt

design. Steroids are not covered for the enhancement of

performance, as this is not considered treatment of disease. Note: Some state-to-state and plan type variations exist.

B. Certain classes of injectable medications are excluded from

coverage under some beneﬁt plans. Please check beneﬁt plan

descriptions for details:

1. Anabolic steroids when used for performance enhancement

** 2. Contraceptive injectable medications.

3. Immunizations for travel

4. Infertility injectable medications

Exception: Infertility injectable medications; are covered only



when required by regulation or covered by a speciﬁc beneﬁt

F40.298

Background

Appendix

Speciﬁc Phobia: DSM 5 Diagnostic Criteria

A marked fear or anxiety about a speciﬁc object or situation (e.g.,

ﬂying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood). Note:

In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying,

tantrums, freezing, or clinging.

The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate

fear or anxiety.

The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with

intense fear or anxiety.

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed

by the speciﬁc object or situation and to the sociocultural context.

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6

months or more.

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically signiﬁcant distress

or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of

functioning.

The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of

another mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of

situations associated with panic-like symptoms or other

incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situations

related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder);

reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress

disorder); separation from home or attachment ﬁgures (as in
