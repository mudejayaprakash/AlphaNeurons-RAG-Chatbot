Discussion/General Information

Upper GI endoscopy, or EGD, is usually performed to evaluate symptoms of persistent upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, or bleeding from the upper GI tract. This procedure is more accurate than diagnostic imaging for detecting inflammation, ulcers, or tumors of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum and can detect early cancer. EGD can also distinguish between benign and malignant conditions when biopsies of suspicious areas are obtained. EGD uses a flexible fiber-optic scope with a light and camera to examine the upper part of the GI system. Channels in the scope support the delivery of water, air, or suction and permit introduction of medical instruments to perform biopsies, cautery, or other procedures. The scope is inserted through the mouth into the upper GI tract allowing for visualization of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum through the camera.

The quality of evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of EGD is lacking for the majority of the most common uses of the technology. In an effort to provide safe recommendations to guide clinical practice in the use of EGD, the American Society

for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) have established practice guidelines based largely on consensus within these respective specialty medical societies.

In 2012, the ASGE published a broad guideline entitled: Appropriate use of GI Endoscopy. The guideline contains several position statements based on a critical review of available evidence as well as expert consensus. The ASGE has also published several indication-specific guidelines such as: The Role of Endoscopy in Barrett’s Esophagus and other Premalignant Conditions of the Esophagus (2012), The Role of Endoscopy in Gastroduodenal Obstruction and Gastroparesis (2011), The Role of Endoscopy in Dyspepsia (2015), The Role of Endoscopy in the Management of Benign and Malignant Gastroduodenal Obstruction (2021), and The Role of Endoscopy in the Diagnosis of Malignancy in Biliary Strictures of Undetermined Etiology (2023). The indication-specific guidelines also contain recommendations based on consensus and a review of the literature. Each recommendation was graded on the quality of the supporting evidence in accordance with the definitions in Table 1 shown below at the bottom of this discussion section. The ACG has also published indication-specific clinical practice guidelines on the use of endoscopy in commonly encountered clinical scenarios, such as: Diagnosis and Management of Barrett's Esophagus: an Updated ACG Guideline (Shaheen 2022), Diagnosis and Management of Achalasia (Vaezi, 2020), and Gastroparesis (Camilleri, 2022). The ACG’s recommendations are graded in accordance with the same definitions as the ASGE, which appear in Table 1 below. The medically necessary indications in this clinical guideline are largely consistent with ASGE, ACG and AGA recommendations that are graded as ‘moderate’ to ‘high’ quality where the ACG has not considered the recommendation ‘conditional’ (“uncertainty about the tradeoffs”) or the AGA has not considered the recommendation ‘weak’ (“recommendation not suitable for quality or performance measure”). Where there was discordance, criteria are based on expert consensus.

An AGA guideline (Wang, 2021) provides advice regarding surveillance intervals using endoscopy after removal of dysplastic lesions and early GI cancers with endoscopic submucosal dissection. These criteria are also based on expert consensus, and the authors acknowledge that the level of evidence available to support much of the surveillance advice is generally low.

Screening for Barrett’s esophagus

Major gastroenterological specialty societies recommend screening only for individuals at high risk for development of Barret’s esophagus (BE) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

The ACG guideline for diagnosis and management of Barrett’s esophagus (Shaheen, 2022) includes the following statement on screening:

We suggest a single screening endoscopy for patients with chronic GERD symptoms and 3 or more additional risk factors for BE, including male sex, age >50 years, White race, tobacco smoking, obesity, and family history of BE or EAC in a first-degree relative (strength of recommendation: conditional; quality of evidence: very low).

The ASGE (2012) guideline states that: “Risk factors for BE and EAC include male sex, white race, age older than 50 years, family history of BE, increased duration of reflux symptoms, smoking, and obesity”.

Neither the ACG (Shaheen, 2022) nor the ASGE (2012) recommend screening the general population for Barrett’s esophagus.

The AGA clinical practice guideline for endoscopic eradication therapy of BE (Rubenstein, 2024) does not address screening or surveillance.

Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer

Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome that is characterized by a high prevalence of diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer caused by inactivating germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CDH1 (Blair, 2020). Individuals with CDH1 pathogenic gene variants are advised to consider prophylactic total gastrectomy, generally between 20 and 30 years of age. For those who wish to defer or avoid gastrectomy, endoscopic surveillance is an option. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN, 2025) advises that the age for prophylactic gastrectomy or initiation of surveillance, including among children aged under 18 years, should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion, considering personal and family history and individual preference. After an initial EGD examination, repeat endoscopy in 6 to 12 months is recommended if the individual continues to express a preference for endoscopic surveillance. The ACG guideline (Morgan, 2025) on diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions states that individuals with a family history suggestive of hereditary cancer should receive genetic counseling, and potential endoscopic screening should be individualized based on the syndrome-specific guidelines and individual

preferences. The AGA guideline (Shah, 2025) on screening and surveillance in individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer states that endoscopy is the best test for screening and surveillance in individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer. Studies have shown that endoscopic screening can detect foci of gastric cancer, including signet ring cell carcinoma, and plays an important role in diagnosis and risk stratification of individuals with pathogenic CDH1 variants (Kumar, 2019; Laszkowska, 2023; Mejia Perez, 2024).

Lynch syndrome

Lynch syndrome predisposes individuals to multiple cancers including gastric and small bowel due to germline pathogenic variants in the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 or the EPCAM gene. For individuals with these variants, NCCN recommends upper GI surveillance with high-quality EGD starting at age 30-40 years and repeat every 2-4 years (category 2A recommendation). Similar surveillance recommendations for Lynch syndrome have been made by the ACG (Syngal, 2015) and the European Society of Digestive Oncology (ESDO) (Vangala, 2018). Several studies have demonstrated that endoscopic screening detects upper GI cancers, precancerous lesions, and other clinically actionable findings that favor its use to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality in individuals with Lynch syndrome (Ceravolo, 2021; Farha, 2022; Kumar, 2020; Ladigan-Badura, 2021; Vedantam, 2023).

GERD

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as “symptoms or complications resulting from the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus or beyond, into the oral cavity (including larynx) or lung” (Flores, 2019). Increased BMI, waist circumference or weight are associated with the presence of GERD (Katz, 2013; Flores, 2019). Typical symptoms of GERD include dyspepsia, epigastric pain, early satiety, belching, and bloating (Katz, 2013). As noted by Brethauer (2014) “treatment of GERD is initially medical with acid suppression but if symptoms are refractory to medical therapy or if there is an associated anatomic etiology for the GERD, surgical revision may be required”.

The ACG 2022 guideline on GERD (Katz, 2022) notes that “There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of GERD. Thus, the diagnosis is based on a combination of symptom presentation, endoscopic evaluation of esophageal mucosa, reflux monitoring, and response to therapeutic intervention.” For patients with classic GERD symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation who have no alarm symptoms, ACG recommends an 8-week trial of empiric proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) once daily before a meal. The AGA (Yadlapati, 2022) concurs and further finds that “if troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain do not respond adequately to a PPI trial or when alarm symptoms exist, clinicians should investigate with endoscopy.” The ACG recommendation on upper endoscopy for diagnosing GERD is as follows:

Upper endoscopy is the most widely used objective test for evaluating the esophageal mucosa. For patients with GERD symptoms who also have alarm symptoms such as dysphagia, weight loss, bleeding, vomiting, and/or anemia, endoscopy should be performed as soon as feasible. The endoscopic findings of EE [erosive esophagitis] and Barrett’s esophagus are specific for the diagnosis of GERD.

The 2025 ASGE guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD (Desai, 2025) recommends upper endoscopy for individuals with GERD with alarm symptoms. For those with no alarm symptoms, endoscopic evaluation is suggested in those with BE risk factors (family history of BE or esophageal adenocarcinoma; GERD plus another risk factor [at least 50 years old, male sex, white race, smoking, or obesity]). Endoscopy is also recommended for individuals who have had a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and are experiencing reflux symptoms. In individuals who had SG and are asymptomatic, the ASGE suggests endoscopic screening for 3 years after SG and then every 5 years. In individuals after peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), there is a high rate of GERD and periodic endoscopic evaluation in asymptomatic individuals should be considered. Regarding SG and POEM, the recommendations are conditional with very low quality of evidence.

Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to adopt a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card.

Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.
