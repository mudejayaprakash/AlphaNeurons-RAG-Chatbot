History/Background and/or General Information

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disease characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep. The disruption in airﬂow caused by OSA has been

associated with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia, cerebrovascular disease, excessive daytime sleepiness, and mood disorders. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has long been the primary treatment modality of choice for OSA, showing improvements in many comorbidities. Unfortunately,

despite attempts to improve compliance, many people are unable to tolerate treatment with CPAP. Because of the large percentage of patients not tolerating CPAP, alternative treatment strategies are necessary.

The hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and

intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem as a number of small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles

it supplies into the tongue. There are two hypoglossal nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.

The concept of stimulating the tongue musculature to increase upper airway size and limit

the pathophysiologic obstruction leading to OSA was introduced in the late 1980s. A variety of strategies were utilized, including transcutaneous stimulation with placement of electrodes in the submental region, sublingual mucosa, and soft palate. However, these studies were limited by their lack of selective stimulation of the primary protrusor of the

tongue, the genioglossus muscle. In 2001, Schwartz et al performed a trial in which they selectively stimulated the branches of the hypoglossal nerve, innervating the genioglossus. They noted a signiﬁcant improvement in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and O2 desaturation nadir. This technology was subsequently reﬁned, and in 2014 the Stimulation

Therapy for Apnea Reduction (STAR) trial was published as the initial clinical trial using upper airway stimulation (UAS) as an alternative therapy to CPAP for treatment of OSA.

The only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - approved hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) system has three implantable components: a stimulation lead that delivers mild

stimulation to maintain multilevel airway patency during sleep, a breathing sensor lead that senses breathing patterns, and a generator that monitors breathing patterns. The two external components are a patient sleep remote that provides a noninvasive means for a

patient to activate the generator and a physician programmer that allows the physician to noninvasively interrogate and conﬁgure the generator settings. The system battery life for the implantable components is 7 to 10 years.

A surgeon implants the system containing a neurostimulator subcutaneously in the patient’s chest, with one lead attached to the patient’s hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) at the base of the tongue and one lead implanted in the patient’s chest. The lead in the chest consists of a pressure sensor that detects breathing. Information about respiration rate is relayed to the device, which stimulates the hypoglossal nerve in the tongue. When stimulated, the tongue moves forward, opening the airway. The patient can operate the device by remote control, which the patient activates before going to sleep. The device turns

on after 20 minutes to minimize disrupting the patient’s sleep onset; the device must be manually turned off via remote when the patient wakes.

Covered Indications

FDA-approved hypoglossal nerve neurostimulation is considered medically reasonable and necessary for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea when all of the following criteria are met:

1. Beneﬁciary is 22 years of age or older; and

Strollo, et al. for the STAR Trial Group evaluated the clinical safety and effectiveness of upper-airway stimulation at 12 months for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea . The study included 126 participants; 83% were men. The mean age was 54.5 years, and the mean BMI was 28.4. Exclusion criteria were a BMI of more than 32.0, neuromuscular disease, hypoglossal-nerve palsy, severe restrictive or obstructive pulmonary

1

disease, moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, severe valvular heart disease, New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, recent myocardial infarction or severe cardiac arrhythmias (within the past 6 months), persistent uncontrolled hypertension despite medication use, active psychiatric disease, and coexisting nonrespiratory sleep disorders that would confound functional sleep assessment. The study was designed by the sponsor (Inspire Medical Systems), the investigators, and the FDA as a multicenter, prospective, single-group trial with participants serving as their own controls. The primary

outcome evaluation was followed by a randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal study that included a subgroup of consecutive participants selected from the population that had a response to therapy. The primary outcome measures were assessed by means of overnight polysomnography and scored by an independent core laboratory with the use of standard criteria. The data analysis was performed by the independent statistician.

Participants underwent screening that included polysomnography, medical and surgical consultation, and endoscopy during drug-induced sleep. Participants were excluded if the AHI score from the screening polysomnography was less than 20 or more than 50 events per hour, if central or mixed sleep-disordered breathing events accounted for more than 25% of all apnea and hypopnea episodes, or if the AHI score while the person was not in a supine position was less than 10 events per hour. Participants were also excluded if pronounced anatomical abnormalities preventing the effective use or assessment of upper-

airway stimulation were identiﬁed during the surgical consultation (e.g., tonsil size of 3 or 4 [tonsils visible beyond the pillars or extending to midline]) or if complete concentric collapse at the retropalatal airway was observed on endoscopy performed during drug-induced sleep. Qualiﬁed participants underwent a surgical procedure to implant the upper-airway stimulation system (Inspire Medical Systems). The stimulation electrode was placed on the hypoglossal nerve to recruit tongue-protrusion function; the sensing lead was placed between the internal and external intercostal muscles to detect ventilatory effort; the

neurostimulator was implanted in the right ipsilateral mid-infraclavicular region.

The primary outcome was the change in the severity of obstructive sleep apnea in the study population, as assessed by means of the AHI and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI; the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by greater than or equal

to 4 percentage points from baseline). The co-primary outcome was the proportion of participants with a response from baseline to 12 months with respect to the primary outcome measures of the AHI and ODI scores. A response as measured by means of the AHI was deﬁned as a reduction of at least 50% from baseline in the AHI score and an AHI score

on the 12-month polysomnography of less than 20 events per hour. The ODI was chosen as a stable integrative outcome value of all forms of sleep-disordered breathing. A response as measured by means of the ODI was deﬁned as a reduction of at least 25% from baseline in the ODI score. The prespeciﬁed primary efﬁcacy objectives were response rates of at least

50%, as assessed by means of the AHI and ODI. All participants who received an implant were included in the primary outcome analysis; participants who did not complete the 12- month visit were considered not to have had a response.

Secondary outcome measures included self-reported sleepiness and disease-speciﬁc quality

of life as assessed with the use of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (scores range from 0.0 to 24.0, with higher scores indicating more daytime sleepiness), disease-speciﬁc quality of life, as assessed with the use of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ; scores range from 5.0 to 20.0, with higher scores indicating greater functioning), and the percentage of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90%.

At the 12-month visit, the ﬁrst 46 consecutive participants who met the criterion of having a response to therapy were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to the therapy-maintenance group or the therapy-withdrawal group . This design ﬁltered out persons who had not had a response to therapy. The therapy-withdrawal group had the device turned off for 7 days, whereas the therapy-maintenance group continued with the device turned on. Polysomnography was performed after the randomization period to measure the effects of therapy withdrawal, as compared with continued use of the therapy.

1

The scores on the AHI and ODI (primary outcome measures) were lower (indicating fewer episodes of sleep apnea) at 12 months than at baseline. The median AHI score decreased 68%, from the baseline value of 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour. The median ODI score decreased 70%, from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour. At the 12-month

visit, the criteria for the coprimary outcome of a reduction of at least 50% in the AHI score from baseline and an AHI score of less than 20 events per hour were met by 66% of the participants (83 of 126 participants; lower boundary of the 97.5% conﬁdence interval [CI], 57). The criterion for the coprimary outcome of a reduction of at least 25% in the ODI score from baseline was met by 75% of participants (94 of 126; lower boundary of the 97.5% CI, 66). Both primary efﬁcacy outcomes exceeded the predeﬁned study objectives.

Scores on the FOSQ and Epworth Sleepiness Scale indicated signiﬁcant improvement at 12 months, as compared with baseline. The median percentage of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90% decreased from a baseline value of 5.4% to 0.9% at 12 months. The average increase in the AHI score in the therapy-withdrawal group was 18.2 events per hour, whereas the average increase in the therapy-maintenance group was 1.7 events per

hour (difference in changes in mean scores, 16.4±12.0 events per hour; P less than 0.001). A similar effect was observed with respect to the mean ODI scores.

Two participants had a serious device-related adverse event requiring repositioning and ﬁxation of the neurostimulator to resolve discomfort. No permanent tongue weakness was reported during the study. Most of the device-related events that were not considered to be

serious resolved after the participants acclimated to the upper-airway stimulation therapy or after the device was reprogrammed to adjust the stimulation variables.

The daily use of upper-airway stimulation was 86%, as assessed on the basis of self-report. A control group of therapeutic CPAP users (i.e., a comparative-effectiveness design) would

be impractical, given the current study design.

The randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal study in which some participants had the

therapy turned off for 1 week provided evidence that the therapeutic effect established at 12 months was attributable to the upper-airway stimulation therapy, rather than variability in

the AHI score.

STAR Trial 18 month follow-up:

Dedhia, et al. for the STAR Trial Group evaluated the stability of improvement in polysomnographic measures of sleep disordered breathing, patient reported outcomes, the

durability of hypoglossal nerve recruitment and safety at 18 months in the Stimulation Treatment for Apnea Reduction (STAR) trial participants . This was a prospective

2

multicenter single group trial with participants serving as their own controls. Primary outcome measures were the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the 4% oxygen desaturation

index (ODI). Secondary outcome measures were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the

Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and oxygen saturation percent time < 90% during sleep. Stimulation level for each participant was collected at three predeﬁned

thresholds during awake testing. Procedure- and/or device-related adverse events were reviewed and coded by the Clinical Events Committee.

The median AHI was reduced by 67.4% from the baseline of 29.3 to 9.7/h at 18 months. The median ODI was reduced by 67.5% from 25.4 to 8.6/h at 18 months. The FOSQ and ESS

improved signiﬁcantly at 18 months compared to baseline values. The functional threshold was unchanged from baseline at 18 months. Two participants experienced a serious device-

related adverse event requiring neurostimulator repositioning and ﬁxation. No tongue weakness reported at 18 months.

The authors concluded that upper airway stimulation via the hypoglossal nerve maintained a durable effect of improving airway stability during sleep and improved patient reported

outcomes (Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire) without an increase of the stimulation thresholds or tongue injury at 18 months of follow-up.

STAR Trial 24 month follow-up:

On behalf of the STAR Trial Investigators evaluated the long-term (24-month) effect of cranial nerve upper airway stimulation (UAS) therapy on patient-centered obstructive sleep

3

apnea (OSA) outcome measures . This was a prospective, multicenter, cohort study of 126 patients with moderate to severe OSA who had difﬁculty adhering to positive pressure

therapy and received the surgically implanted UAS system. Outcomes were measured at

baseline and postoperatively at 12 months and 24 months, and included self- and bedpartner-report of snoring intensity, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Functional

Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ). Additional analysis included FOSQ subscales, FOSQ-10, and treatment effect size.

Signiﬁcant improvement in mean FOSQ score was observed from baseline (14.3) to 12 month (17.3), and the effect was maintained at 24 month (17.2). Similar improvements and

maintenance of effect were seen with all FOSQ subscales and FOSQ-10. Subjective daytime sleepiness, as measured by mean ESS, improved signiﬁcantly from baseline (11.6) to 12

month (7.0) and 24 month (7.1). Self-reported snoring severity showed increased percentage of "no" or "soft" snoring from 22% at baseline to 88% at 12 months and 91% at

24 mo. UAS demonstrated large effect size (greater than 0.8) at 12 and 24 months for overall ESS and FOSQ measures, and the effect size compared favorably to previously

published effect size with other sleep apnea treatments.

The authors concluded that in a selected group of patients with moderate to severe OSA

and body mass index less than or equal to 32 kg/m2, hypoglossal cranial nerve stimulation therapy can provide signiﬁcant improvement in important sleep related quality-of-life

outcome measures and the effect is maintained across a 2-year follow-up period.

STAR Trial 36 month follow-up:

On behalf of the STAR Trial Investigators describe the 36-month clinical and polysomnography (PSG) outcomes in an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) cohort treated with

4 hypoglossal cranial nerve upper airway stimulation (UAS) .

Of 126 enrolled participants, 116 (92%) completed 36-month follow-up evaluation per

protocol; 98 participants additionally agreed to a voluntary 36-month PSG. Self-report daily device usage was 81%. In the PSG group, 74% met the apriori deﬁnition of success with the

primary outcomes of apnea-hypopnea index, reduced from the median value of 28.2 events

per hour at baseline to 8.7 and 6.2 at 12 and 36 months, respectively. Similarly, self-reported outcomes improved from baseline to 12 months and were maintained at 36 months. Soft or

no snoring reported by bed partner increased from 17% at baseline to 80% at 36 months.

Serious device-related adverse events were rare, with 1 elective device explanation from 12 to 36 months.

The authors concluded that long-term 3-year improvements in objective respiratory and subjective quality-of-life outcome measures are maintained. Adverse events are uncommon.

UAS is a successful and appropriate long-term treatment for individuals with moderate to severe OSA.

STAR Trial 48 month follow-up:

On behalf of the STAR Trial Investigators assess patient-based outcomes of participants in a

large multicenter prospective cohort study-the STAR trial-48 months after implantation with 5 an upper airway stimulation system for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea .

A total of 91 subjects completed the 48-month visit. Daytime sleepiness as measured by ESS was signiﬁcantly reduced (P equal to .01), and sleep-related quality of life as measured

by FOSQ signiﬁcantly improved (P equal to .01) when compared with baseline. Soft to no snoring was reported by 85% of bed partners. Two patients required additional surgery

without complication for lead malfunction.

The authors concluded that upper airway stimulation maintained a sustained beneﬁt on

patient-reported outcomes (ESS, FOSQ, snoring) at 48 months in select patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea.

STAR Trial 5 year outcomes:

On behalf of the STAR Trial Investigators present 5-year outcomes from a multicenter

prospective cohort of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who were treated with upper airway stimulation (UAS) via a unilateral hypoglossal nerve implant . From a cohort of

6

126 patients, 97 completed protocol, and 71 consented to a voluntary polysomnogram. Those having continuous positive airway pressure failure with moderate to severe OSA,

body mass index less than 32 kg/m2, and no unfavorable collapse on drug-induced sleep

endoscopy were enrolled in a phase 3 trial. Prospective outcomes included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index, and adverse events, as well as measures of

sleepiness, quality of life, and snoring.

Patients who did and did not complete the protocol differed in baseline AHI, oxygen

desaturation index, and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire scores but not in any other demographics or treatment response measures. Improvement in sleepiness (Epworth

Sleepiness Scale) and quality of life was observed, with normalization of scores increasing

from 33% to 78% and 15% to 67%, respectively. AHI response rate (AHI less than 20 events per hour and greater than 50% reduction) was 75% (n equal to 71). When a last

observation carried forward analysis was applied, the responder rate was 63% at 5 years.

Serious device-related events all related to lead/device adjustments were reported in 6% of patients.

The authors concluded that there were improvements in sleepiness, quality of life, and

respiratory outcomes are observed with 5 years of UAS. Serious adverse events are uncommon. UAS is a nonanatomic surgical treatment with long-term beneﬁt for individuals

with moderate to severe OSA who have failed nasal continuous positive airway pressure.

Evidence-Based Practice Guidelines and Position Statements

American Academy of Sleep Medicine

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diagnostic

Testing for Adult OSA states that the third edition of the International Classiﬁcation of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) deﬁnes OSA as a PSG-determined obstructive respiratory disturbance

index (RDI) greater than or equal to 5 events/hour associated with the typical symptoms of OSA (e.g., unrefreshing sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue or insomnia, awakening with a

gasping or choking sensation, loud snoring, or witnessed apneas), or an obstructive RDI

greater than or equal to 15 events/hour (even in the absence of symptoms).

American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS)

In 2016, the American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery issued a

position statement on hypoglossal nerve stimulation for treatment of obstructive sleep

apnea (OSA) which states “The American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery considers upper airway stimulation (UAS) via the hypoglossal nerve for the

treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea syndrome to be an effective second-line treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in patient who are intolerant or

unable to achieve beneﬁt with positive pressure therapy (PAP). Not all adult patients are candidates for UAS therapy and appropriate polysomnographic, age, BMI and objective

upper airway evaluation measures are required for proper patient selection.”

International Society for Sleep Surgery

15/24

10/9/25, 5:12 PM

LCD - Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (L38312)

International Society for Sleep Surgery states that Cranial nerve (hypoglossal nerve)

stimulation is among surgical treatments and procedures that “have been shown to be effective in the treatment of sleep disordered breathing/obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in

adults (and/or children) when applied to selected patients based on their anatomy,

physiology, body mass index and neck size, prior therapy and co-morbidities. Patient should have undergone an appropriate evaluation(s) prior to treatment which may include

polysomnography, home sleep testing, awake or drug induced sleep endoscopy, and possible cephalometric or other radiographic evaluations.”

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)

In 2017, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued an interventional

procedure guidance (IPG598) which states: “Current evidence on the safety and efﬁcacy of hypoglossal nerve stimulation for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea is limited in

quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit for research.”

CAC Advisory Committee (CAC) Evidentiary Summary

After review of the literature, the consensus among the CAC Advisory Committee (CAC)

panel was positive for hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) as a viable treatment option for patients with moderate to severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Upper airway stimulation

(UAS) compared favorably with sleep surgeries (e.g., uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP], trans-oral robotic surgery [TORS]) used to treat tongue base obstruction. CAC discussions

regarding patient criteria included changing the body mass index (BMI) to <35 based on additional studies that included the higher BMI with successful results, and including

expanded descriptions of limitations to clarify the rationale for limiting certain patients from

this procedure. Also, based on the CAC panel discussion and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it was suggested that the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) should start

at 15 with the upper limit of the AHI being increased to 65. This limit was adopted and the Covered Indications now include patients that have an AHI of 15 to 65 events per hour. In

addition, CAC members agree that providers who underwent FDA approved device manufacturer DISE training prior to the date of this LCD, shall be deemed to meet the criteria

for satisfactory performance of DISE without further documentation. All such providers shall maintain certiﬁcation of completion of this training, supply proof of training by manufacturer

and DISE results should be made available upon request. Finally, not all adults are

candidates for UAS therapy and appropriate polysomnographic, age, BMI and objective upper airway evaluation measures are required for proper patient selection. Overall, this is

an appropriate method of treating OSA for the Medicare population.

LCD - Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (L38312)

Analysis of Evidence (Rationale for Determination)

The evidence on hypoglossal nerve stimulation for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea

(OSA) includes case series and a multicenter, prospective, single group, cohort design study (STAR) that were surgically implanted with an upper airway stimulation device with

obstructive sleep apnea who had difﬁculty either accepting or adhering to CPAP therapy and were followed for 5 years. Prospective cohort study is gold standard for epidemiologic

studies. The study strengths included measuring primary and secondary outcomes and at

12-month visits, a second randomized study within the study where participants were randomly assigned into two groups with one group having the device turned off for 7 days

and the other continued with the device turned on. Polysomnography was performed after the randomization period to measure the effects of therapy withdrawal as compared to

1 continued use of the therapy .

Hypoglossal nerve stimulation has shown improved outcomes in this single arm study when

used in a select group of patients. For the patients that met the inclusion criteria for AHI, BMI and favorable pattern for palatal collapse about two-thirds met the study deﬁnition of

success. Results observed at the 12 month follow-up were maintained at 3 years. Patient based outcomes at 48 months, concluded these patients maintained a sustained beneﬁt on

patient reported outcomes (Epworth Sleepiness Score, Functional Outcomes of Sleep

Questionnaire and snoring). Conclusions from the 5 year outcomes were that UAS is a nonanatomic surgical treatment with long-term beneﬁt for individuals with moderate to

severe OSA who have failed nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Safety and effectiveness were evaluated using multiple outcome measures.

For individuals with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with hypoglossal nerve stimulation, the evidence is sufﬁcient to determine that the technology results in a

meaningful improvement in the net health outcome when utilized as outlined in this LCD.
