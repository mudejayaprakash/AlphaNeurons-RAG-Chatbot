Coverage Rationale

Indications for Coverage Introduction UnitedHealthcare covers certain medical services under the preventive care services benefit. The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires non-grandfathered health plans to cover certain “recommended preventive services” as identified by PPACA under the preventive care services benefit, without cost sharing to members when provided by network providers. This includes: Evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of “A” or “B” in the current recommendations of the

United States Preventive Services Task Force.

Preventive Care Services UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy

Immunizations for routine use in children, adolescents and adults that have in effect a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

With respect to infants, children and adolescents, evidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided for in

the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.

With respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings as provided for in comprehensive guidelines

supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.

Member Cost-Sharing Non-Grandfathered Plans Non-grandfathered plans provide coverage for preventive care services with no member cost sharing (i.e., covered at

100% of Allowed Amounts without deductible, coinsurance, or copayment) when services are obtained from a Network provider.

Under PPACA, services obtained from an out-of-network provider are not required to be covered under a plan’s

preventive benefit and may be subject to member cost sharing. Refer to the member specific benefit plan document for out-of-network benefit information, if any.

Grandfathered Plans Plans that maintain grandfathered status under PPACA are not required by law to provide coverage for these

preventive services without member cost sharing; although a grandfathered plan may choose to voluntarily amend its plan document to include these preventive benefits.

Except where there are state mandates, a grandfathered plan might include member cost sharing, or exclude some of

the preventive care services identified under PPACA.

Refer to the member specific benefit plan document for details on how benefits are covered under a grandfathered

plan.

Preventive vs. Diagnostic Services Certain services can be done for preventive or diagnostic reasons. When a service is performed for the purpose of preventive screening and is appropriately reported, it will be considered under the preventive care services benefit. This includes services directly related to the performance of a covered preventive care service (refer to the Frequently Asked Questions section for additional information.)

Preventive services are those performed on a person who: has not had the preventive screening done before and does not have symptoms or other abnormal studies suggesting

abnormalities*; or

has had screening done within the recommended interval with the findings considered normal; or has had diagnostic services results that were normal after which the physician recommendation would be for future

preventive screening studies using the preventive services intervals.

In the case of a colonoscopy done as a follow-up to a positive stool-based screening (e.g., FIT, FOBT, and fecal DNA) or direct visualization screening (e.g., sigmoidoscopy or CT colonography), refer to FAQ#4 below.

When a service is done for diagnostic purposes, it will be considered under the applicable non-preventive medical benefit. Diagnostic services are done on a person who: had abnormalities found on previous preventive or diagnostic studies that require further diagnostic studies; or had abnormalities found on previous preventive or diagnostic studies that would recommend a repeat of the same

studies within shortened time intervals from the recommended preventive screening time intervals; or

had a symptom(s) that required further diagnosis; or does not fall within the applicable population for a recommendation or guideline.

Covered Breastfeeding Equipment Personal-use electric breast pump: The purchase of a personal-use electric breast pump (HCPCS code E0603).

o This benefit is limited to one pump per birth. In the case of a birth resulting in multiple infants, only one breast

pump is covered.

o A breast pump purchase includes the necessary supplies for the pump to operate.

Replacement breast pump supplies necessary for the personal-use electric breast pump to operate. This includes: standard power adaptor, tubing adaptors, tubing, locking rings, bottles specific to breast pump operation, caps for bottles that are specific to the breast pump, valves, filters, and breast shield and/or splash protector for use with the breast pump.

Breastmilk storage bags (HCPCS code A4287).

Colonoscopies Colonoscopy – Preventive Care Services Benefit (Without Member Cost-Sharing) Member cost-sharing for colonoscopy is waived when all of the following apply: • The patient’s age is 45-75 years (ends on 76th birthday) as recommended by the USPSTF; and • The provider is participating in the network; and • When billed in accordance with the coding in the Colorectal Cancer Screening row listed in this policy.

Colonoscopy may require a site of service review. Refer to the Medical Policies titled Screening Colonoscopy Procedures – Site of Service and Outpatient Surgical Procedures – Site of Service.

Colonoscopy – Medical Benefit (With Member Cost-Sharing) Member cost-sharing may apply when a colonoscopy is done in any one of the following scenarios: • The patient’s age is outside of the age recommendation of the USPSTF (age 45-75 years); or • The provider is non-network; or • Colonoscopy performed with a shortened time interval outside of the USPSTF recommendations; or • Colonoscopy performed for diagnostic purposes; or • Colonoscopy performed for surveillance purposes (e.g., a follow-up colonoscopy performed after identification or

removal of a polyp or cancer on a previous colonoscopy); or • Colonoscopy performed for therapeutic/treatment purposes.

The above colonoscopies may require advanced notification and/or site of service review. Refer to the Gastrointestinal Colonoscopy Procedure Guidelines and the Medical Policy titled Outpatient Surgical Procedures – Site of Service.

Coverage Limitations and Exclusions Services not covered under the preventive care benefit may be covered under another portion of the medical benefit

plan.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1

Q:

If a polyp is encountered during a preventive screening colonoscopy, are future colonoscopies considered under the preventive care services benefit?

A: No. If a polyp is removed during a preventive screening colonoscopy, future colonoscopies would normally be considered to be diagnostic because the time intervals between future colonoscopies would be shortened.

2

Q: Are the related therapeutic services for a preventive colonoscopy covered under the preventive care

benefit?

A: Yes, related services integral to a colonoscopy are covered under the preventive care services

benefit including: pre-operative examination, the associated facility, anesthesia, polyp removal (if necessary), pathologist and physician fees. However, the preventive benefit does not include a post- operative examination.

3

Q: Do any preventive care services require prior-authorization? A: Certain services require prior-authorization on most benefit plans. This includes, but may not be limited to: BRCA lab screening, computed tomographic colonography (virtual colonoscopy), and screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography.

4

Q:

If a member in the age range of 45-75 years has a positive stool-based colorectal cancer screening test (e.g., FIT, FOBT, and fecal DNA) or direct visualization screening test (e.g., sigmoidoscopy or CT colonography), and has a follow up colonoscopy, is the colonoscopy included in the preventive care services benefit?

A: Yes, in this situation, the colonoscopy would be considered under the preventive care services

benefit when billed in accordance with the coding in the Colorectal Cancer Screening row listed in this policy.

5

Q: For preventive services that have a diagnosis code requirement, does the listed diagnosis code

need to be the primary diagnosis on the claim?

A:

In general, most preventive services do not require the preventive diagnosis code to be in the primary position. However, certain preventive services do require the diagnosis code to be in the primary position, which include: (1) Chemoprevention of Breast Cancer (Counseling), (2) Genetic Counseling and Evaluation for BRCA Testing, and (3) Prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection.

6

Q:

If a woman has an abnormal finding on a preventive screening mammography and the follow up mammogram was found to be normal, will UnitedHealthcare cover her future mammograms under the preventive care services benefit?

A: Yes, if the member was returned to normal mammography screening protocol, her future

mammography screenings would be considered under the preventive care services benefit.

7

Q:

If a member had elevated cholesterol on a prior preventive screening, are future cholesterol tests considered under the preventive care services benefit?

A: Once the diagnosis has been made, further testing is considered diagnostic rather than preventive.

This is true whether or not the member is receiving pharmacotherapy.

8

Q: Are the related services for a woman’s outpatient sterilization or other contraceptive procedure

covered under the preventive care benefit?

A: Related services for a woman’s outpatient sterilization or other contraceptive procedure are covered under the preventive care services benefit. This includes associated implantable devices, facility fee, anesthesia, and surgeon/physician fees. If a woman is admitted to an inpatient facility for another reason (e.g., maternity/delivery), and has a sterilization or other contraceptive procedure performed during that admission, the sterilization or other contraceptive procedure fees mare covered under

the preventive care services benefit. This includes associated sterilization/ contraception surgical fees, device fees, anesthesia, pathology, and physician fees. However, the facility fees are not covered under the preventive care benefit since the sterilization or other contraceptive procedure is incidental to, and is not the primary reason, for the inpatient admission. Q: Are blood draws/venipunctures included in the preventive care benefit? A: Yes, blood draws/venipunctures are considered under the preventive benefit if billed for a covered

9

preventive lab service that requires a blood draw.

10

Q:

Is a newly-combined vaccine (a vaccine with several individual vaccines combined into one) covered under preventive care benefits?

A: A new vaccine that is pending ACIP recommendations, but is a combination of previously approved

individual components, may be eligible under the preventive care benefit.

11

Q: Are preventive care services affected by other policies? A: Yes, including for example, the Reimbursement Policy titled Preventive Medicine and Screening

Policy describes situations which may affect reimbursement of preventive care services.

12

Q: Are travel vaccines covered under preventive care benefits? A: Benefits for preventive care services include vaccines for routine use in children, adolescents and adults that have in effect a recommendation from ACIP with respect to the individual involved. Vaccines that are specific to travel (e.g., typhoid, yellow fever, cholera, plague, and Japanese encephalitis virus) are excluded from the preventive care services benefit.

13

Q: Does the preventive care services benefit include prescription or over the counter (OTC) items? A: Refer to the plan’s pharmacy benefit plan administrator for details on prescription medications and

OTCs available under the plan’s preventive benefit.
