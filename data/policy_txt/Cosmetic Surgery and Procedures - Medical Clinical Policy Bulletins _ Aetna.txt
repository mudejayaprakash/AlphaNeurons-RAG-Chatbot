Notes

Introduction

Aetna plans exclude coverage of cosmetic surgery and procedures that

are not medically necessary, but generally provide coverage when the

surgery or procedure is needed to improve the functioning of a body part

or otherwise medically necessary even if the surgery or procedure also

improves or changes the appearance of a portion of the body.

Additionally, many Aetna plans specify that certain surgeries are not

considered to be cosmetic (e.g., surgery to correct the result of injury,

post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, breast augmentation to treat

gender dysphoria, surgery needed to treat certain congenital defects such

as cleft lip or cleft palate). Please check benefit plan descriptions for

details.

This policy statement supplements plan coverage language by identifying

procedures that Aetna considers medically necessary despite cosmetic

aspects, and other cosmetic procedures that Aetna considers not

medically necessary. Please note that, while this policy statement

addresses many common procedures, it does not address all procedures

that might be considered to be cosmetic surgery excluded from

coverage. Aetna reserves the right to deny coverage for other

procedures that are cosmetic and not medically necessary.

Background

Mest and Humble (2009) evaluated the long-term safety, duration of

effect, and satisfaction with serial injections of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) for

HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy. In this single-site, open-label, re-

treatment study, 65 HIV-positive patients were treated with injectable

https://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/1_99/0031.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com

19/56

PLLA every 5 weeks (until optimal re-correction). Presenting degree of

lipoatrophy based on the James scale (1 = mild, 4 = severe) was

reviewed. Skin thickness was measured at fixed points with calipers.

Patients completed a post-retreatment satisfaction questionnaire. Nearly

10 % of patients had persistent correction greater than 36 months, based

on patient report. Approximately 50 % required 3 or fewer re-treatments

to maintain satisfactory correction (determined by patient and physician).

Milder facial lipoatrophy (James scale score 1 to 2) on initial presentation

required fewer re-treatments and had more sustained correction. Time to

first re-treatment varied according to James scale score: 1 (21.4 months)

and 4 (13.0 months). The majority of patients required or asked for 4 re-

treatments or less over a 24-month period. The mean patient satisfaction

score was 4.9 (1 = dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied) at study end. No

serious adverse events were reported. The authors concluded that

injectable PLLA is a safe and effective long-term treatment option for HIV-

associated lipoatrophy.

The cosmetic surgery exclusion precludes payment for any surgical

procedure directed at improving appearance. The condition giving rise to

the patient's pre-operative appearance is generally not a consideration.

The only exception to the exclusion is surgery for the prompt repair of an

accidental injury or for the improvement of a malformed body member

which coincidentally serves some cosmetic purpose. Since surgery to

correct a condition of "moon face" which developed as a side effect of

cortisone therapy does not meet the exception to the exclusion, it is not

covered under Medicare (§1862(a)(10) of the Act).

An UpToDate review on “Overview of breast disorders in children and

adolescents” (Banikarim and De Silva, 2012) states that “Tuberous breast

is a variant of breast development in which the base of the breast is

limited and the nipple and areola are overdeveloped. The etiology is

unknown. If the breast examination is otherwise normal, the patient may

be referred for cosmetic surgery. The available surgical options vary

depending on the location of the hypoplastic breast tissue …. Teenagers

may seek breast augmentation for reconstructive purposes related to

congenital defects (e.g., amastia, severe breast asymmetry, tuberous

breast) or for purely aesthetic reasons”.

Cosmetic Surgery and Procedures - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

Food and Drug Administration-approved for the correction of moderate-to-

severe facial wrinkles and folds, small gel-particle hyaluronic acid (SGP-

HA, Restylane, Medicis Aesthetics, Inc., Scottsdale, AZ) and large gel-

particle hyaluronic acid (LGP-HA, Perlane, Medicis Aesthetics, Inc.,

Scottsdale, AZ) were studied to evaluate their safety for the correction of

oral commissures, marionette lines, upper perioral rhytides and naso-

labial folds (NLFs). Brandt et al (2011) examined the safety of SGP-HA

and LGP-HA in treating facial wrinkles and folds around the mouth; the

secondary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of these products.

This open-label, 4-week study at 2 U.S. centers evaluated SGP-HA and

LGP-HA in patients who intended to undergo intradermal injection for

correction of perioral wrinkles and folds. At screening, a 5-grade Wrinkle

Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) was used to evaluate the baseline

appearance of bilateral NLFs, and a 6-grade Wrinkle Severity (WS) scale

was used to evaluate the appearance of bilateral oral commissures,

marionette lines and upper perioral rhytides. To qualify, each patient

must have had moderate-to-severe wrinkles at 1 pair of marionette lines

and upper perioral rhytides. Each wrinkle was treated to optimal

correction with either SGP-HA or LGP-HA at the discretion of the treating

investigator. All reported local and systemic adverse events (AEs) were

recorded. At 2 weeks after treatment or touch-up, the treating

investigator and the patient assessed appearance using the Global

Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). A total of 20 patients with a mean

age of 59.6 years (range of 49 to 65) were treated with an average of

5.58 +/- 1.15 ml of HA for the entire perioral area. Treatment areas

included NLFs, marionette lines, oral commissures and perioral rhytides;

18 of 20 patients received both SGP-HA and LGP-HA. Product was

injected into the mid or deep dermis using primarily linear threading and

multiple punctate pools. Patients experienced a total of 66 treatment-

emergent AEs (TEAEs); each patient experienced at least 1 TEAE. The

reported events in decreasing order of occurrence were bruising,

tenderness, swelling, redness, headache and discomfort. Bruising was

more common in the NLFs and marionette lines than in the oral

commissures and perioral rhytides. Tenderness occurred more often in

the perioral rhytides than in the other areas. The maximum intensity of all

TEAEs was considered mild. Most TEAEs resolved within 7 days, with

an average duration of 4 days. No serious TEAEs occurred during the

study; 100 % of GAIS evaluations by both investigators and patients

indicated improvement, regardless of filler used or area treated. The

authors concluded that both SGP-HA and LGP-HA were found to be safe

and effective for the correction of perioral wrinkles and folds, with few

differences among treatment areas. Both investigator and patient GAIS

evaluations indicated aesthetic improvement after SGP-HA and LGP-HA

treatment in the perioral area.

Cohen et al (2013) systematically reviewed published evidence for

aesthetic use of SGP-HA and LGP-HA. Clinical data on anatomic area,

level of evidence, patient population, trial design, endpoints, efficacy, and

safety were extracted from PubMed. A total of 53 primary clinical reports

were analyzed. The highest-quality efficacy evidence was for the NLFs,

with 10 randomized, blind, split-face, comparative trials. Several

randomized, blind trials supported treatment of the glabella, lips, and

hands. Lower-level evidence (from studies with non-randomized, open-

label, or retrospective designs) was recorded for the naso-jugal folds (tear

troughs), upper eyelids, nose, infra-orbital hollows, oral commissures,

marionette lines, perioral rhytides, temples, and cheeks. Common AEs

across anatomic areas were pain, bruising, swelling, and redness.

Serious AEs were uncommon (8 events in 8 patients of 4,605 total

patients) and were considered to be unrelated (7 events) or probably

unrelated (1 event) to treatment. The authors concluded that the safety

and effectiveness of SGP-HA and LGP-HA are well-established for NLFs;

evidence for the glabella, lips, and hands is more limited. Preliminary

reports in other anatomic regions suggested effectiveness without major

complications.

While products containing a hyaluronic acid gel (e.g., Perlane and

Restylane) are available to improve the contours of the skin, the presence

of depressions and/or wrinkles is not a functional impairment. Thus, the

use of SGP- HA and LGP-HA for improvement of the skin's contour

and/or reduce depressions due to acne, injury, scars, or wrinkles is

cosmetic.

Aesthetic Alteration of the Female Genitalia

Triana and Robledo (2015) noted that aesthetic surgery of the external

genitalia in women encompasses many procedures and may address the

labia minora, clitoral hood, labia majora, mons pubis, or vaginal opening.

During the initial evaluation, the surgeon should consider all aspects of

https://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/1_99/0031.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com

22/56

Cosmetic Surgery and Procedures - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

the external genitalia to develop an appropriate surgical plan. It may be

necessary to perform 2 or more procedures during the same surgical

session to achieve the desired aesthetic result. In this continuing medical

education (CME) article, these investigators reviewed the literature and

summarized the available cosmetic techniques for female external

genitalia. Resection of the labia minora has been described in several

peer-reviewed reports. They also discussed the procedures and

modifications to direct resection, wedge resection, and de-epithelialization

of the labia minora. Aesthetic surgery of the clitoral hood may involve

straight-line resection, extended wedge resection, or inverted V

hoodoplasty. The mons pubis may be treated with mons pubis pexy,

wedge resection, or lipo-modeling. The labia majora can be managed

with direct resection or lipo-modeling, and hymenoplasty may be

performed to correct a wide vaginal opening.

Hunter and associates (2016) stated that aesthetic alteration of the

genitalia is increasingly sought by women unhappy with the size, shape,

and appearance of their vulva. Although the labia minora are usually the

focus of concern, the entire anatomic region -- labia minora, labia majora,

clitoral hood, perineum, and mons pubis -- should be evaluated in a pre-

operative assessment of women seeking labiaplasty. Labiaplasty is

associated with high patient satisfaction and low complication rates.

These investigators discussed the 3 basic labia minora reduction

techniques -- edge excision, wedge excision, and central de-

epithelialization -- as well as their advantages and disadvantages to

assist the surgeon in tailoring technique selection to individual genital

anatomy and aesthetic desires. The authors presented key points of the

pre-operative anatomic evaluation, technique selection, operative risks,

peri-operative care, and potential complications for labia minora, labia

majora, and clitoral hood alterations, based on a large operative

experience. They stated that labiaplasty competency should be part of

the skill set of all plastic surgeons.

On July 30, 2018, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner

Scott Gottlieb stated that “We’ve recently become aware of a growing

number of manufacturers marketing “vaginal rejuvenation” devices to

women and claiming these procedures will treat conditions and symptoms

related to menopause, urinary incontinence or sexual function. The

procedures use lasers and other energy-based devices to destroy or

reshape vaginal tissue. These products have serious risks and don’t

have adequate evidence to support their use for these purposes. We are

deeply concerned women are being harmed. As part of our efforts to

promote women’s health, the FDA has cleared or approved laser and

energy-based devices for the treatment of serious conditions like the

destruction of abnormal or pre-cancerous cervical or vaginal tissue, as

well as condylomas (genital warts). But the safety and effectiveness of

these devices hasn’t been evaluated or confirmed by the FDA for “vaginal

rejuvenation”. In addition to the deceptive health claims being made with

respect to these uses, the “vaginal rejuvenation” procedures have serious

risks. In some cases, these devices are being marketed for this use to

women who have completed treatment for breast cancer and are

experiencing symptoms caused by early menopause. The deceptive

marketing of a dangerous procedure with no proven benefit, including to

women who’ve been treated for cancer, is egregious. In reviewing

adverse event reports and published literature, we have found numerous

cases of vaginal burns, scarring, pain during sexual intercourse, and

recurring or chronic pain. We haven’t reviewed or approved these

devices for use in such procedures. Thus, the full extent of the risks is

unknown. But these reports indicate these procedures can cause serious

harm. Today, we’re warning women and their healthcare providers that

the FDA has serious concerns about the use of these devices to treat

gynecological conditions beyond those for which the devices have been

approved or cleared. We recently notified seven device manufacturers of

our concerns about inappropriate marketing of their devices for “vaginal

rejuvenation” procedures. They are: Alma Lasers, BTL Industries,

Cynosure, InMode, Sciton, Thermigen and Venus Concept. We

requested that the manufacturers address our concerns within 30 days. If

our concerns are not addressed, then the FDA will consider what next

actions, including potential enforcement actions, are appropriate. This

matter has the full attention of our professional staff”.

Body Dysmorphic Disorder

Hundscheid and associates (2014) noted that patients suffering from

body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are preoccupied with a slight or

imagined defect in appearance. First of all, to review the literature on the

prevalence of BDD in cosmetic surgery and thereafter to review the

literature on psychiatric co-morbidity and the outcome of surgical

https://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/1_99/0031.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com

interventions. These investigators based their search strategy on

Embase, Medline and PubMed, using the search terms "body dysmorphic

disorder", "cosmetic surgery", "prevalence", "comorbidity" and

"outcome". The search covered English and Dutch literature published

after the introduction of BDD in DSM-III-R and before 1 November, 2013.

A study of the relevant articles enabled these investigators to access

additional articles mentioned in these texts. The initial search strategy

turned out to be too narrow. It was therefore broadened to include "body

dysmorphic disorder", "cosmetic surgery", and "prevalence". Eventually

these researchers included 23 original articles. In 11 of these the

prevalence of BDD varied from 3.2 to 53.6 %; 12 articles on psychiatric

co-morbidity revealed predominantly mood and anxiety disorders on axis

I and cluster C personality disorders on axis II. Only 2 studies reported

on the outcome of cosmetic surgery performed on BDD patients; surgical

interventions, however, seemed to result in new preoccupations with the

prolongation of psychiatric co-morbidity. The authors concluded that BDD

is a common psychiatric disorder that could sometimes lead to cosmetic

surgery. Moreover, they stated that pre-operative screening of BDD

patients is vital so that efficient psychiatric treatment can be initiated and

patients are not subjected to surgical interventions that may be ineffective

or even harmful.

Bowyer and colleagues (2016) stated that a high proportion of individuals

with BDD undergo cosmetic treatments in an attempt to "fix" perceived

defect(s) in their physical appearance. Despite the frequency with which

such procedures are sought, few studies have prospectively examined

the outcomes of cosmetic procedures in individuals with BDD. These

investigators reviewed the literature and discussed the current debate

that exists on outcomes of cosmetic treatment for individuals with BDD.

An emerging literature suggests the majority of individuals with BDD have

poor outcomes after cosmetic interventions; however, based on the

current literature, it cannot be fully ruled out that certain individuals with

mild BDD and localized appearance concerns may benefit from these

interventions. The authors noted that gaps in the current literature were

highlighted, alongside recommendations for future research. They stated

that carefully conducted longitudinal studies with well-characterized

patient populations are needed.

10/25/25, 12:26 PM

Cosmetic Surgery and Procedures - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

Sweis and co-workers (2017) noted that BDD is an often under-

recognized yet severe psychiatric illness. There is limited guidance for

plastic surgeons in the U.S. in how to recognize and manage patients

with BDD and protect themselves from potential litigation and harm.

Therefore, in collaboration with legal counsel, these investigators

reminded their profession of the serious nature of patients with BDD,

provided warning signs for recognizing BDD, and critically evaluated the

validity of informed consent and the legal ramifications of operating on

such patients in this country. These investigators performed a literature

review to define the psychopathology of BDD and identify cases of

patients with BDD who underwent cosmetic surgery resulting in potential

threats to the surgeon. They also carried out an additional search of the

legal literature in collaboration with legal counsel to identify key cases of

patients with BDD attempting litigation following cosmetic surgery

procedures. The diagnostic criteria and psychopathology of BDD were

presented. Warning signs were highlighted to alert the plastic surgeon to

patients at high risk for BDD. Strategies for legal protection include a pre-

procedure check-list for patients who were suspected of having a BDD

diagnosis. The authors concluded that BDD is prevalent in the cosmetic

surgery population. Patients with BDD often have a poor outcome

following aesthetic surgery, which can result in a dangerous or even

deadly situation for the surgeon. The authors aimed to remind aesthetic

plastic surgeons of the psychopathology, severity, and specific risks

associated with operating on patients with BDD while suggesting specific

protective strategies.

Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum-aaes (Qwo)

Collagenase clostridium histolyticum-aaes is available as Qwo (Endo

Aesthetics LLC) subcutaneous injection. In 2020, Qwo, a combination of

bacterial collagenases, was U.S. FDA approved for the treatment of

moderate to severe cellulite in the buttocks of adult women. FDA approval

was based on two randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-

controlled trials which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Qwo for

treatment of cellulite in adult women. A dose of 0.84 mg of Qwo per

buttock was administered as 12 subcutaneous injections (0.3-mL injection

administered as three 0.1-mL aliquots per injection) in each of 2 buttocks

for a total dose of 1.68 mg and a total volume of 7.2 mL (3.6 mL per

buttock) per treatment visit. There were 3 treatment visits at 21-day

intervals. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of 2-level

multi-component responders at Day 71 post randomization. A 2-level

multi-component responder was defined as having an improvement of at

least 2 levels of cellulite severity from baseline on both the Clinician

Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS) and the

Patient Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR-PCSS) in the

target buttock. Patient satisfaction with the appearance of their cellulite

was assessed using a patient reported outcome scale ranging from 0

(extremely dissatisfied) to 6 (extremely satisfied). Reductions in cellulite

severity were observed more frequently in the Qwo group compared to

the placebo group as measured by the investigator (CR-PCSS) and

patient (PR-PCSS) scales at Day 71 (Endo, 2021).

Warnings and precautions include hypersensitivity reactions and injection

site bruising. The most common adverse reactions (1 % or more) were

related to the injection site (bruising, pain, nodule, pruritus, erythema,

discoloration, swelling, and warmth).

Qwo must not be substituted for other injectable collagenase products.

Qwo is not indicated for the treatment of Peyronie's disease or

Dupuytren’s contracture. For treatment of Peyronie's disease or

DaxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm Injection (Daxxify)

DaxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm injection is available at Daxxify (Revance

Therapeutics, Inc.). In September 2022, the FDA approved Daxxify

injection, an acetylcholine release inhibitor and neuromuscular blocking

agent, for the temporary improvement of moderate to severe frown lines

(glabellar lines) in adults. FDA approval was based on two randomized,

double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trials, Studies GL-1

and GL-2. A total of 405 subjects were randomized and 406 were treated

with 40 Units of daxibotulinumtoxinA and 204 subjects were randomized

and 203 were treated with an equal volume of placebo. Subjects were

excluded if they had eyelid ptosis, deep dermal scarring, excessive

dermatochalasis or an inability to lessen glabellar lines by physically

spreading them apart. The total dose was delivered in 5 equally divided

intramuscular injections of 8 Units each to specific sites in the glabellar.

Subjects were followed for at least 24 weeks after treatment. Efficacy was

determined through the assessment by investigators and subjects of

frown wrinkle severity at maximum frown using a 4-point scale (0 = none,

1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The primary efficacy endpoint

(treatment success) was defined as achieving a score of 0 or 1 (none or

mild) and an improvement of at least 2 points from baseline for both the

investigator’s and subject’s assessments at Week 4. The results found

that 74 percent of subjects achieved a greater than two-grade

improvement in glabellar lines at week 4 per both investigator and patient

assessment. Eight-eight percent achieved greater two-grade

improvement at week 4 and 98 percent achieved none or mild wrinkle

severity at week 4.

Daxxify is generally safe and well tolerated with no serious treatment-

related adverse events reported in the clinical trials and has a safety

profile consistent with other currently available neuromodulators in the

or more) are headache (6%), eyelid ptosis (2%) and facial paresis (1%).

Deoxycholic Acid Injection (e.g., Kybella)

Sykes and associates (2017) noted that deoxycholic acid (DCA; Kybella,

Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) is a novel injectable treatment used

for the cosmetic reduction of redundant submental fat. By inducing

adipose cell lysis, the soft tissue alteration induces subsequent contour

change and sharpening of the cervico-mental angle. The safety and

efficacy have been well established in several prospective clinical trials

and subsequent FDA approval for this purpose. This has provided an

effective and less invasive alternative to surgical liposuction with virtually

no recovery time and less overall discomfort. Given its success for use in

this context, a logical step would be to extrapolate to other regions of the

body where cosmetic deformity is caused by excessive adipose tissue. In

this study, the authors proposed potential options for further use in

various targeted areas where subcutaneous fat may be amenable to

reduction with DCA injection, understanding that such uses would be off-

label and require an understanding of the regional anatomy and possible

complications.

Jegasothy (2018) stated that injection lipolysis using DCA is a minimally

invasive technique recently approved by the FDA to treat subcutaneous

fat in the submental area, by injecting a cytolytic drug into the superficial

adipose tissue. It is the first and only FDA-approved injectable treatment

for improving the appearance of moderate-to-severe convexity or fullness

associated with submental fat in adults. Given the safety and efficacy of

DCA injection lipolysis in the submental area, its use for body contouring

in other anatomical areas to treat small volume, localized fat deposits

should be explored. This technique can be a therapeutic approach for

mild excess fat in the pectoralis/underarm/triceps/upper back (collectively

called the “bra-line” in women) in carefully selected patients, usually with

a BMI of less than 25. This report highlighted the author’s earliest

experience with injectable treatment of bra-line fat accumulation in 2

patients and was the 1st U.S. report of DCA lipolysis in this anatomic

region. This area is relatively difficult to treat with other modalities but

appeared to be responsive to DCA injection. Safety can be ensured by

administering DCA only in the subcutaneous fat. Thorough knowledge of

the anatomy of underlying structures and skin thickness is essential.

Efficacy can be maximized by careful patient selection. This investigator

noted that lipolysis with DCA injection administered by trained physicians

is a promising approach for treating bra-line fat. It is likely that most

patients will need significantly more DCA per injection session. The

author stated that large-scale clinical trials are needed to prove the safety

and efficacy of this approach.

Sung and colleagues (2019) stated that injectable DCA is currently

approved only for treatment of persistent submental fat (SMF). Many

cosmetic surgeons use DCA off-label to treat fat tissue in other areas of

the body. There is no review summarizing the off-label uses of injectable

DCA. These researchers carried out a systematic literature search

through PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases

using search terms “ATX-101 OR Kybella OR deoxycholic OR

deoxycholate NOT amphotericin NOT bile” in accordance to PRISMA

guidelines to identify off-label uses for injectable DCA or ATX-101. A total

of 10 pertinent articles were identified for review. Anatomic areas treated

include the face, brassiere line, foot, and gluteo-trochanteric region.

Indications included facial contouring, paradoxical adipose hyperplasia,

HIV/HAART-associated buccal fat pad lipodystrophy, and reduction of

lipomatous tumors. DCA is effective at causing lipolysis and safe with

minimal side effects. Most patients treated for cosmetic indications

reported high patient satisfaction. The authors concluded that off-label

use of injectable DCA showed a similar safety profile, effectiveness, and

overall patient satisfaction compared to FDA-approved use for persistent

SMF. DCA appeared to be a safe and effective alternative to surgical

reduction of unwanted adipose tissue in non-submental areas. Moreover,

these researchers stated that larger-scale studies are needed to examine

further cosmetic and potential medical applications.

Liu and colleagues (2021) stated that beyond submental fat reduction,

injectable DCA has gained popularity in recent years for various minimally

invasive lipolysis applications. In a systematic review, these researchers

examined the evidence of off-label uses of injectable DCA. Medline,

Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and CENTRAL were searched. The

outcomes measured included applications of DCA, treatment regimen,

and its effectiveness. An overall success rate for each condition was

calculated based on the improvement defined in the included studies. A

total of 11 studies examined the cosmetic use of DCA for excess adipose

tissue on various anatomical locations. The outcomes were examined at

time-points ranging from 1 to 21 months post-treatment, with overall

success rates over 85 %; 8 case reports and series reported the success

of using DCA in the treatment of lipomas, xanthelasmas, paradoxical

adipose hyperplasia, fibrofatty residue of infantile hemangioma,

piezogenic pedal papules, and HIV-associated lipo-hypertrophy. Although

the preliminary effectiveness was high, the overall recommendations for

off-label uses were weak because of the lack of high-level studies. The

authors concluded that the findings of this review emphasized the

diversity of injectable DCA as a minimally invasive technique for lipolysis.

Moreover, these researchers stated that further high-level studies

demonstrating consistent treatment regimens and methods of evaluation

are needed to make more definitive recommendations regarding off-label

DCA use.

Laviv (Azﬁcel-T)

Laviv (azficel-T) is an autologous cellular product indicated for

improvement of the appearance of moderate-to-severe nasolabial fold

wrinkles in adults.

Smith and colleagues (2012) noted that changes associated with aging

are partly due to loss of collagen and elastin. Treatment with autologous

fibroblasts grown in culture (azficel-T) could help correct the appearance

of aging by replacing lost dermal constituents. In a multi-center, double-

blind, placebo-controlled trial, these researchers examined the safety and

effectiveness of autologous fibroblasts in the treatment of naso-labial fold

(NLF) wrinkles. Adults with moderate-to-very severe NLF wrinkles were

randomized to receive 3 treatments with autologous fibroblasts or

placebo at 5-week intervals. Blinded evaluators and subjects evaluated

efficacy using a validated wrinkle assessment scale. A total of 372

subjects were enrolled and underwent treatment; 78 % of subjects treated

with autologous fibroblast therapy and 48 % of subjects treated with

placebo achieved at least a 1-point improvement on the subject

assessment at 6 months (p < 0.001), and 64 % of subjects treated with

autologous fibroblast therapy and 36 % of those treated with placebo

showed at least a 1-point improvement evaluator's assessment (p <

0.001); AEs were generally mild, and the treatment was well-tolerated.

The authors concluded that autologous fibroblast therapy was safe and

effective for the treatment of NLF wrinkles. The availability of autologous

cell therapy marked the beginning of a new phase in aesthetic therapy.

LetibotulinumtoxinA-wlbg (Letybo)

LetibotulinumtoxinA-wlbg is branded as Letybo (Hugel, Inc.). On February

29, 2024, the FDA approved Letybo, an acetylcholine release inhibitor

and a neuromuscular blocking agent, for the temporary improvement in

the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines associated with

corrugator and/or procerus muscle activity in adult patients. FDA approval

was based on the safety and efficacy results obtained from three clinical

trials (BLESS I [NCT02677298], BLESS II [NCT02677805], and BLESS III

[NCT03985982]), which included a total of 1,271 patients with moderate

to severe glabellar lines (wrinkles between the eyebrows). These trials

were conducted at 31 sites in the United States and European Union.

Cosmetic Surgery and Procedures - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

Patients between 18 and 75 years of age received a single intramuscular

injection of Letybo or placebo at five sites within the muscles between the

eyebrows. The benefit of Letybo was assessed by determining the

proportion of patients achieving a score of 0 or 1 (none or mild) and at

least a 2-grade improvement of wrinkles between the eyebrows at

maximum frown from baseline to Week 4. Improvement of wrinkles

between the eyebrows at maximum frown was assessed independently

by both the investigator and the patient using the Glabellar Line Scale

(GLS). The GLS is a 4-point grading scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 =

moderate, 3 = severe).

Labeled warnings and precautions include the following:

Spread of toxin eﬀects; swallowing and breathing diﬃculties can

lead to death.

Potency Units of Letybo are not interchangeable with other

preparations of botulinum toxin products.

Potential serious adverse reactions after Letybo injections for

unapproved uses.

Adverse event reports have been received involving the

cardiovascular system, some with fatal outcomes.

Concomitant neuromuscular disorder may exacerbate clinical

eﬀects of treatment.

To be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory

function or dysphagia.

The most common adverse reaction is headache (2%).

Liposuction for the Treatment of Lipedema

Lipedema is a painful disorder in women characterized by abnormal

deposition of adipose tissue in the lower extremities leading to

circumferential bilateral lower extremity enlargement typically seen

extending from the hips to the ankles resulting in edema, pain and

bruising; with secondary lymphedema and fibrosis during later stages.

The pathogenesis is unknown and no curative treatment is available.

Conservative therapy consisting of lymphatic drainage and compression

stockings is often recommended, but is only effective against the edema.

Some patients showed a short-term improvement when treated in this

way. Combined decongestive therapy (CDT, namely manual lymphatic

drainage, compression garments) is the standard of care in most

countries. Since the introduction of tumescent technique, liposuction has

been used as a surgical therapeutic option.

Rapprich and colleagues (2011) stated that the removal of the increased

fat tissue of lipedema has become possible by employing advanced

liposuction techniques, which utilize vibrating micro-cannulas under

tumescent local anesthesia. These investigators examined the

effectiveness of this approach to lipedema. A total of 25 patients were

examined before liposuction and 6 months thereafter. The survey

included the measurement of the volume of the legs and several

parameters of typical pain and discomfort. The parameters were

measured using visual analogue scales (VAS, scale 0 to 10). The volume

of the leg was reduced by 6.99 %. Pain, as the predominant symptom in

lipedema, was significantly reduced from 7.2 ± 2.2 to 2.1 ± 2.1 (p <

0.001). Quality of life (QOL) as a measure of the psychological strain

caused by lipedema improved from 8.7 ± 1.7 to 3.6 ± 2.5 (p < 0.001).

Other parameters also showed a significant improvement and the over-all

severity score improved in all patients. The authors concluded that

liposuction reduced the symptoms of lipedema significantly.

Schmeller and associates (2012) examined the efficacy of liposuction

concerning appearance and associated complaints after a long-term

period. A total of 164 patients who had undergone conservative therapy

over a period of years, were treated by liposuction under tumescent local

anesthesia with vibrating micro-cannulas. In a monocentric study, 112

could be re-evaluated with a standardized questionnaire after a mean of 3

years and 8 months (range of 1 year and 1 month to 7 years and 4

months) following the initial surgery and a mean of 2 years and 11

months (8 months to 6 years and 10 months) following the last surgery.

All patients showed a distinct reduction of subcutaneous fatty tissue

(average of 9,846 ml per person) with improvement of shape and

normalization of body proportions. Additionally, they reported either a

marked improvement or a complete disappearance of spontaneous pain,

sensitivity to pressure, edema, bruising, restriction of movement and

cosmetic impairment, resulting in a tremendous increase in QOL; all

these complaints were reduced significantly (p < 0·001). Patients with

lipedema stage II and III showed better improvement compared with

patients with stage I. Physical decongestive therapy could be either

omitted (22.4 % of cases) or continued to a much lower degree. No

serious complications (wound infection rate 1.4 %, bleeding rate 0.3 %)

were observed following surgery. The authors concluded that tumescent

liposuction was a highly effective treatment for lipedema with good

morphological and functional long-term results.

Peled and co-workers (2012) stated that diagnosis of lipedema is often

challenging, and patients frequently undergo a variety of unsuccessful

therapies before receiving the proper diagnosis and appropriate

management. Patients may experience pain and aching in the lower

extremity in addition to distress from the cosmetic appearance of their

legs and the resistance of the fatty changes to diet and exercise. These

researchers reported a case of a patient with lipedema who was treated

with suction-assisted lipectomy and use of compression garments, with

successful treatment of the lipodystrophy and maintenance of improved

aesthetic results at 4-year post-operative follow-up.

Wollina and associates (2014) noted that In advanced stages of

lipedema, reduction of adipose tissue is the only available effective

treatment. In elderly patients with advanced lipedema, correction of

increased skin laxity has to be considered for an optimal outcome. These

investigators reported on a tailored combined approach to improve

advanced lipedema in elderly women with multiple co-morbidities. Micro-

cannular laser-assisted liposuction of the upper legs and knees was

performed under tumescent anesthesia. Medial thigh lift and partial lower

abdominoplasty with minimal undermining were used to correct skin laxity

and prevent intertrigo (intertriginous dermatitis). Post-surgical care with

non-elastic flat knitted compression garments and manual lymph

drainage were used. These researchers reported on 3 women aged 55

to 77 years with advanced lipedema of the legs and multiple co-

morbidities. Using this step-by-step approach, a short operation time and

early mobilization were possible. Minor adverse effects were temporary

methemoglobinemia after tumescent anesthesia and post-surgical pain.

No severe adverse effects were observed; and patient satisfaction was

high. The authors concluded that a tailored approach may be useful in

advanced lipedema and was applicable even in elderly patients with

multiple co-morbidities.

Atiyeh and colleagues (2015) stated that liposuction is the most common

cosmetic surgical procedure worldwide. It has evolved from being

designed primarily for body contouring to becoming essential adjunct to

various other aesthetic procedures, greatly enhancing their outcome.

Despite its hard clear differentiation between an aesthetic and therapeutic

indication for some pathologic conditions, liposuction has been

increasingly used in various disorders as a therapeutic tool or to improve

function. In fact, liposuction has ceased to define a specific procedure

and has become synonymous to a surgical technique or tool similar to the

surgical knife, laser, electrocautery, suture material, or even wound-

dressing products. At present, there appeared to be an enormous

potential for the application of liposuction in ablative and reconstructive

surgery outside the realm of purely aesthetic procedures. These

investigators considered the various non-aesthetic applications of

liposuction; implications of this new definition of liposuction should induce

3rd-party public payers and insurance carriers to reconsider their

remuneration and reimbursement policies.

Dadras and associates (2017) examined the outcome of liposuction used

as treatment for lipedema. A total of 25 patients who received 72

liposuction procedures for the treatment of lipedema completed a

standardized questionnaire. Lipedema-associated complaints and the

need for CDT were assessed for the pre-operative period and during 2

separate post-operative follow-ups using a VAS and a composite CDT

score. The mean follow-up times for the 1st post-operative follow-up and

the 2nd post-operative follow-up were 16 months and 37 months,

respectively. Patients showed significant reductions in spontaneous pain,

sensitivity to pressure, feeling of tension, bruising, cosmetic impairment,

and general impairment to QOL from the pre-operative period to the 1st

post-operative follow-up, and these results remained consistent until the

2nd postoperative follow-up. A comparison of the pre-operative period to

the last post-operative follow-up, after 4 patients without full pre-operative

CDT were excluded from the analysis, indicated that the need for CDT

was reduced significantly. An analysis of the different stages of the

disease also indicated that better and more sustainable results could be

achieved if patients were treated in earlier stages. The authors

concluded that liposuction was effective in the treatment of lipedema and

led to an improvement in QOL and a decrease in the need for

conservative therapy.

Reich-Schupke and co-workers (2017) noted that the revised guidelines

on lipedema were developed under the auspices of and funded by the

German Society of Phlebology (DGP). The recommendations were

based on a systematic literature search and the consensus of 8 medical

societies and working groups. The guidelines contain recommendations

with respect to diagnosis and management of lipedema. The diagnosis is

established on the basis of medical history and clinical findings.

Characteristically, there is a localized, symmetrical increase in

subcutaneous adipose tissue in arms and legs that is in marked

disproportion to the trunk. Other findings include edema, easy bruising,

and increased tenderness. Further diagnostic tests are usually reserved

for special cases that require additional work-up. Lipedema is a chronic,

progressive disorder marked by the individual variability and

unpredictability of its clinical course. Treatment consists of 4 therapeutic

mainstays that should be combined as necessary and address current

clinical symptoms: complex physical therapy (manual lymphatic drainage,

compression therapy, exercise therapy, and skin care), liposuction and

plastic surgery, diet, and physical activity, as well as psychotherapy if

necessary. Surgical procedures are indicated if, despite thorough

conservative treatment, symptoms persist, or if there is progression of

clinical findings and/or symptoms. If present, morbid obesity should be

therapeutically addressed prior to liposuction.

Halk and Damstra (2017) noted that in 2011, the Dutch Society of

Dermatology and Venereology organized a task force to create guidelines

on lipedema, using the International Classification of Functioning,

Disability and Health of the World Health Organization (WHO). Clinical

questions on significant issues in lipedema care were proposed,

involving: making the diagnosis of lipedema; clinimetric measurements for

early detection and adequate follow-up; and treatment. A systematic

review of literature published up to June 2013 was conducted. Based on

available evidence and experience of the task force, answers were

formed and recommendations were stated. The guidelines defined

criteria to make a medical diagnosis of lipedema, a minimum data set of

(repeated) clinical measurements that should be used to ensure early

detection and an individually outlined follow-up plan, pillars on which

conservative treatment should be based and recommendations on

surgical therapeutic options. The authors concluded that little consistent

information concerning either diagnostics or therapy could be found in the

literature. It is likely that lipedema is frequently misdiagnosed or wrongly

diagnosed as only an aesthetic problem and therefore under-treated or

mistreated. Treatment is divided into conservative and chirurgic

treatment. The only available technique to correct the abnormal adipose

tissue is surgery. To ensure early detection and an individually outlined

follow-up, the committee advised the use of a minimum data set of

(repeated) measurements of waist circumference, circumference of

involved limbs, body mass index (BMI) and scoring of the level of daily

practice and psychosocial distress. Promotion of a healthy lifestyle with

individually adjusted weight control measures, graded activity training

programs, edema reduction, and other supportive measures are pillars of

conservative therapy. Tumescent liposuction is the treatment of choice

for patients with a suitable health profile and/or inadequate response to

conservative and supportive measures.

Rey and colleagues (2018) stated that lipedema is a progressive disease;

the signs are limited to the lower limbs. Early signs are non-specific,

which is why the diagnosis is often ignored. Later, pain and heaviness of

lower limbs become predominant. Finally, at an advanced stage, tissue

fibrosis is associated with significant edema. At this stage, patients

become severely disabled and bedridden. At the early stage, the

treatment is conservative. Liposuction is indicated at the onset of pain.

Its effectiveness on pain and long-term control has been demonstrated.

Finally, late stages require heavy and complex surgeries combining

dermo-lipectomy as well as liposuction.

Selective Neurectomy of the Gastrocnemius Muscle for Correction

of Calf Hypertrophy

Wang and colleagues (2015) stated that liposuction alone is not always

sufficient to correct the shape of the lower leg, and muscle reduction may

be necessary. These researchers evaluated the outcomes of a new

technique of selective neurectomy of the gastrocnemius muscle to correct

calf hypertrophy. Between October 2007 and May 2010, a total of 300

patients underwent neurectomy of the medial and lateral heads of the

gastrocnemius muscle at the Department of Cosmetic and Plastic

Surgery, the Second People's Hospital of Guangdong Province

(Guangzhou, China) to correct the shape of their lower legs. Follow-up

data from these 300 patients were analyzed retrospectively. Cosmetic

results were evaluated independently by the surgeon, the patient, and a

third party. Pre-operative and post-operative calf circumferences were

compared. The Fugl-Meyer motor function assessment was evaluated 3

months after surgery. The average reduction in calf circumference was

3.2 ± 1.2 cm. The Fugl-Meyer scores were normal in all patients both

before and 3 months after surgery. A normal calf shape was achieved in

all patients; 6 patients complained of fatigue while walking and 4 of scar

pigmentation, but in all cases, this resolved within 6 months. Calf

asymmetry was observed in only 2 patients. The authors concluded that

the findings of this case-series study suggested that neurectomy of the

medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle may be safe and

effective for correcting the shape of the calves. Level of Evidence= V.

Surgical Removal of Silicone

Levy and Emer (2012) stated that various modalities including systemic

and intralesional corticosteroids, minocycline, anti-tumor necrosis factor

antibodies or surgical removal can be employed to treat silicone

granuloma formation.

Park, et al. (2016) reviewed the management of silicone granulomas. The

authors stated that a diverse spectrum of therapies has been utilized to

treat silicone granulomas and some may resolve spontaneously, but most

are excised surgically or given pharmacological therapy with varying

success. The authors stated that surgical excision may be employed, but

silicone is a permanent filler and is known to migrate to other areas of the

body, making complete removal of the injected material impossible. They

noted that this may lead to even more disfigurement, making it an unlikely

treatment option particularly for facial granulomas.

Lopiccolo et al (2011) reviewed the management of silicone granulomas

after soft tissue injection of the buttocks. The authors noted that the

treatment of silicone granulomas can be challenging, and a number of

modalities have been implemented with varying degrees of success.

Surgical excision was attempted in three reported cases. Two of the three

resulted in complete resolution. The granulomas involved in both of these

cases were well-circumscribed nodular lesions. In the case that did not

result in complete resolution, adequate surgical margins could not be

achieved because of the unknown extent of the granulomatous reaction.

Eyebrow / Eyelash Tattooing

Yang and colleagues (1989) reported on 2 patients with epithelioid

granulomatous inflammation on the eyebrows after undergoing cosmetic

eyebrow tattooing. These investigators analyzed the causative elements

from biopsy specimens and tattoo inks with X-ray micro-analysis. The

authors suggest that granuloma caused by cosmetic eyebrow tattooing

was a complication worthy of mention.

Ro and Lee (1991) reported one case of epithelioid granuloma that

occurred at the site of a previous cosmetic eyebrow tattooing. A biopsy

specimen showed the organized appearance of epithelioid cell

granulomas containing little pigment as well as occasional giant cells,

primarily of Langhans' type; thus, showing the characteristic features of

granulomatous hypersensitivity. With the use of energy dispersive X-ray

micro-analysis and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry, the

presence of copper, iron, cobalt, and chromium was demonstrated.

Lee and associates (2001) noted that eyebrow and eyelash tattooing are

commonly performed procedures that have a very low rate of reported

complications. These investigators described 1 case of infra-orbital

pigmentation following eyelash tattooing and another of peri-orbital

pigmentation following eyebrow tattooing. The authors concluded that

although most complications related to eyelash and eyebrow tattooing,

including pigment fanning, have been reported by ophthalmologists,

pigment fanning was also of concern to dermatologists.

Tehrani and co-workers (2021) stated that eyebrow tattooing is a

relatively common cosmetic procedure for middle-aged women; it can

hide age-related ptosis. In a prospective, non-randomized, case-

controlled study, these researchers examined the peri-ocular soft tissue

changes following eyebrow tattooing and its effects on upper eyelid

blepharoplasty (UEBL). This trial included 28 subjects, 14 with eyebrow

tattooing for at least 5 years and 14 without eyebrow tattooing. Eyebrow

ultrasonography was carried out to measure the peri-ocular soft tissue

thickness including skin and subcutaneous tissue on the medial and

lateral side of the eyebrow. Then, UEBL was carried out with extended

eyelid skin incisions; and the excised tissues evaluated

histopathologically. The mean age of patients was 50.6 ± 0.6 and 51.2 ±

5.59 years in non-eyebrow tattooing (NET) and eyebrow tattooing (ET)

groups, respectively (p = 0.78). In the ET group, soft tissue thickness was

5.90 ± 1.10 and 6.3 ± 0.95 mm on the lateral and medial side of the

eyebrow, respectively, which were significantly thicker compared to the

NET group (4.68 ± 0.69 and 4.78 ± 0.56 mm, respectively) (p = 0.001).

Histopathological findings ranged from edema-congestion to chronic

inflammation and dermal fibrosis that were more frequently observed in

ET group; however, this difference was statistically significant only for

dermal fibrosis (p = 0.02). Surgical wound complications were observed

in 3 patients in the ET group (p = 0.22). The authors concluded that

subjects with eyebrow tattooing, as compared to a control group, showed

a thicker eyebrow skin on ultrasonography and higher upper eyelid

dermal fibrosis on histopathological examination.

The Renuvion Device (Previously Branded as J-Plasma) for

Liposuction

Doolabh (2019) noted that although tumescent liposuction provides

debulking of body areas with excess subcutaneous fat and concurrent

skin laxity, the ability to shrink and re-drape the skin and soft tissue for

added definition has remained an elusive goal. Many modalities

employed to facilitate fat removal utilizing light energy, ultrasonic (US)

energy, or radiofrequency (RF) energy have provided modest skin

shrinkage. Apyx Medical's (formerly Bovie Medical) Renuvion (previously

branded as J-Plasma) has FDA clearance for the cutting, coagulation,

and ablation of soft tissue. In a retrospective, single-center, chart review,

the author collected safety and procedural information for patients who

have previously undergone liposuction with which Renuvion was used as

a tool for sub-dermal coagulation. All procedures occurred before August

2018. A total of 32 patients were identified (3 male and 29 female). The

mean follow-up was 6 months (range of 3 to 8 months). None of the

patients required a revision or secondary procedure suggesting 100 % of

patients had acceptable final outcomes. No device-related AEs or

complications were noted, suggesting that within this dataset, Renuvion's

unique cool helium plasma technology could be safely used for skin

contraction with or without tumescent liposuction or supplemental

modalities used to facilitate fat removal that may otherwise contribute to

the skin contraction. Moreover, these investigators stated that this review

provided clinically relevant data, served as a framework for future

prospective studies including formal assessment of patient satisfaction,

and guided the development and applications of this unique technology.

The authors stated that as with all retrospective chart reviews, limitations

exist in the data collection. These included use of a single-site, small

sample size (n = 32), collection of variables not routinely captured in the

patients’ records (e.g., separation of lipoaspirate volumes of fat from

tumescence), and depth of the passes was not quantified.

The FDA provided an update (February 27, 2023) on the use of

Renuvion/J-Plasma device for certain aesthetic procedures: “Today, we

are informing consumers and health care providers about a Renuvion/J-

Plasma handpiece that can be used under the skin in certain procedures

intended to improve the appearance of loose skin. On July 15, 2022, the

FDA cleared the Renuvion APR Handpiece for use in subcutaneous

dermatological and aesthetic procedures to improve the appearance of

lax (loose) skin in the neck and submental (under the chin) region. The

labeling and training for the Renuvion APR Handpiece will include

updated instructions for device power settings and treatment parameters

specific to use in procedures under the skin for the neck and chin

regions. It is important to note that use of the Renuvion APR Handpiece

has not been cleared or approved for use in any other aesthetic skin

procedure, or in combination with liposuction. The FDA will continue to

monitor reports of adverse events with use of Renuvion/J-Plasma for

aesthetic skin procedures”.

Umbilectomy for the Management of Infected Urachal Cysts

Castillo et al (2007) stated that anomalies of the urachal remnant are

rare. Urachal cysts are usually asymptomatic; however, when they

become infected, they can mimic a wide variety of intra-abdominal

pathologies. These investigators presented the cases of 2 patients in

which a urachal cyst was found. Two men aged 25 and 38 years,

respectively, underwent laparoscopic resection of a urachal remnant. In 1

of the cases the urachal remnant was complicated by infection.

Opportune clinical and radiologic diagnose was made in both cases and

complete excision of the urachal remnant was performed by laparoscopic

means. The procedures were carried out without complications and

follow-up showed excellent results. Both patients presented very short

convalescence with rapid recovery. The authors concluded that the

treatment of choice for urachal pathology was the complete excision of

the complicated lesion. For this matter laparoscopic surgery assured

surgical results comparable to conventional surgery adding the

advantages of a minimally invasive approach.

In a case-reports study and a literature review, Chiarenza et al (2009)

examined the role of laparoscopic excision for the management of

urachal remnants. In a 5-year period, a total of 3 children were

diagnosed with urachal anomalies presenting as abdominal or urinary

symptoms; and were treated by laparoscopic surgery. The average age

was 8.3 years (range of 4 to 13),and there were 2 girls and 1 boy. Mean

operative time was 90 mins (range of 60 to 120), and there were no post-

operative complications. The 3 patients were all discharged by post-

operative day 4. The authors concluded that laparoscopy was a safe and

effective minimally invasive technique in the management of pediatric

urachal anomalies. It was effective even in cases of infected urachal

cysts.

Bertozzi et al (2014) examined laparoscopic treatment of symptomatic

urachal remnants in children. These investigators reviewed their

experience analyzing different approaches and results obtained in an 8-

year period. From July 2005 to September 2013, a total of 12 children

underwent 13 interventions for the treatment of symptomatic urachal

remnants. In 4 patients, the technique was a laparoscopic-assisted

removal of the remnant, in 2 patients, a laparoscopic-assisted drainage of

a urachal abscess, and in 7 patients, a laparoscopic excision of the

remnant; 1 patient underwent a double intervention -- laparoscopic

drainage of an infected urachal remnant and its delayed laparoscopic

excision. The laparoscopic-assisted removal of the urachal remnant was

carried out in 2 cases of infected urachal sinus, in 1 case of symptomatic

sinus, and in 1 case of infected urachal cyst. The laparoscopic-assisted

drainage of urachal abscesses was performed in 2 patients: In 1 patient,

the abscess was because of an infected sinus while in the other patient,

the abscess was caused by an infected cyst. Of the 7 patients treated

with pure laparoscopic technique, 1 had a symptomatic sinus, another

had an association between a symptomatic urachal sinus and a urachal

cyst, and 5 patients had a symptomatic urachal cyst. In all cases, intra-

operative or post-operative complications and recurrences did not occur,

and the cosmetic results were good. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to

8 years and 8 months. The authors concluded that laparoscopic surgery

for symptomatic urachal remnants was safe and reliable in cases of

drainage of urachal abscess and in cases of excision of the remnant.

Laparoscopy allowed a radical excision of the remnants with all the

advantages of this procedure. In case of conversion, laparoscopic-

assisted technique with minimal incision could be a good alternative to

open surgery.

Heuga et al (2015) noted that the classical management of urachal

remnants consists of surgical resection to prevent infections and long-

term malignancies; however, some reports have recently spread a wait

and see management. In a retrospective, single-center study, these

investigators reported the results of the surgical management in their

institution. They reviewed the findings of all patients managed for urachal

remnants from January 2005 to December 2014. A total of 35 patients

have been operated during the study period (18 girls and 17 boys). Mean

age at surgery was 4.9 ± 4.4 years old; 27 patients were referred due to

symptoms whereas 8 were discovered incidentally (4 by ultrasound [US]

scan and 4 during laparoscopy). Among them, 10 were urachal cysts, 15

were urachus sinusa and 10 were patent urachus; 30 were operated

using an open approach and 5 using a laparoscopic approach. Mean

length of stay (LOS) was 3.8 ± 1.7 days (1 to 10) with a mean duration of

bladder drainage of 2.5 ± 1 days. No major complications occurred. No

abnormal tissue was discovered at the histological analysis. The authors

concluded that presentation of urachal remnants was variable but surgical

outcomes remain excellent in the authors’ experience. When symptoms

occur, the surgical decision was easy; however, when the diagnosis was

incidental, the decision was much more complicated. Official guidelines

could ease the decision process and the management of urachal

anomalies.

In a retrospective, observational, single-center study, Sui et al (2023)

examined the extra-peritoneal laparoscopic urachal mass excision

technique and its safety and effectiveness in the treatment of urachal

mass. Baseline characteristics were collected from patients who

underwent surgery to diagnose a urachal cyst or abscess in the authors’

hospital between January 2020 and August 2021. The full-length of the

urachus and part of the top bladder wall were completely removed via the

extra-peritoneal approach. Patient outcomes were collected to examine

surgical safety and effectiveness, including operation time, intra-operative

blood loss, drainage tube removal time, length of stay (LOS), and post-

operative complications. All 20 surgeries were successfully performed

laparoscopically, and no case was converted to open surgery. The mean

body mass index (BMI) of the patients was 24.6 ± 2.2. The mean patient

age was 49.3 ± 8.7 years. The mean size of the cysts was 3.0 ± 0.4 cm.

The mean operation time was 56.3 ± 12.0 mins. The mean intra-

operative blood loss was 28.0 ± 6.4 ml. The mean drainage tube removal

time was 3.0 ± 0.5 days. The mean LOS was 5.2 ± 0.4 days. The mean

follow-up was 13.4 ± 2.1 months. No post-operative complications were

observed during the follow-up period. The short-term follow-up and small

patient cohort limited the outcome evaluation. The authors concluded

that these findings indicated that the extra-peritoneal laparoscopic

approach was a safe and effective method for the treatment of urachal

mass. Moreover, these investigators stated that given the drawbacks of

the study, further multiple and larger sample-sized trials are needed to

confirm these findings.

Furthermore, an UpToDate review on “Care of the umbilicus and

management of umbilical disorders” (Palazzi and Brandt, 2023) states

that “Surgical excision is performed for all symptomatic

omphalomesenteric duct remnants, or remnants such as fibrous bands or

cysts that place the patient at risk for bowel obstruction … Surgical

excision is required for removal of ectopic tissue in the umbilicus …

Surgical excision has been the treatment of choice (for urachal

anomalies)”.

Scrotoplasty

McLeod and Alpert (2014) stated that penoscrotal webbing (PSW) is a

common reason for deferral of neonatal circumcision. Reports of

successful procedures and outcomes in the literature are sparse. These

researchers have carried out double-V scrotoplasty (DVS), a modification

of a V-Y technique, in 138 patients with excellent results. They

retrospectively reviewed the charts of boys who had undergone DVS for

PSW since January 2009 by a single surgeon (S.A.A.). The indications,

intra-operative findings, concomitant procedures, outcomes, and

complications were recorded. A total of 138 DVSs were performed.

Concomitant genital surgeries included 81 hidden penis repairs and 10

other (hernia, hypospadias, chordee, orchidopexy). The median age at

the time of surgery was 9.6 months (6.1 months to 9.8 years). Patients

were evaluated about 1 month post-operatively. In 7 cases (5 %), minor

skin separation occurred at the penoscrotal junction but all healed

completely. Superficial skin infection occurred in 1 patient. None

required re-operation and cosmetic results were subjectively excellent.

The authors concluded that PSW has been corrected in 138 patients

without significant complications and with excellent results. This was the

largest known peer-reviewed series examining a surgical technique for

congenital PSW repair. These investigators believed their technique was

simple, reproducible, and, with no diverging suture lines lateral to the

median raphe, improves cosmesis.

Stojanovic et al (2021) noted that metoidioplasty is a variant of the gender

affirmation technique neo-phalloplasty, where a hormonally enlarged

clitoris is reconstructed to become a small penis. The objectives of

metoidioplasty are male appearance of the genitalia, voiding in standing

position, and completely preserved erogenous sensation of the neo-

phallus. However, it does not enable penetrative sexual intercourse due

to the small dimensions of the neo-phallus. Basic principles of

metoidioplasty were established 50 years ago, and many refinements of

the technique have been reported since. The latest improvements were

based on the advances in urethroplasty, peri-operative care, as well as

new insights into female genital anatomy. The current metoidioplasty

technique is a 1-stage procedure that entails vaginectomy, straightening

and lengthening of the clitoris, urethral reconstruction by combined flaps

and grafts, and scrotoplasty with insertion of testicular implants. Good

aesthetic, functional, and - outcomes were attained with this type of neo-

phalloplasty.

Miller et al (2021) stated that labia majora, the embryologic homologs of

the scrotum, are ideal donor tissue for transgender scrotoplasty. In a

retrospective study, these investigators discussed the technique, and

surgical outcomes were assessed for scrotoplasty using labia majora

rotational advancement flaps. They reviewed the outcomes of

phalloplasty patients who underwent either primary or secondary labia

majora flap scrotoplasty and perineal reconstruction from October 1, 2017

to December 1, 2019. Bilateral elevation and rotational flap advancement

from the posterior to anterior position formed a pouch-like scrotum.

Perineal reconstruction entailed multi-layered closure with apposition of

the inner thigh skin. The mean follow-up was 12.5 months (0.5 to 26

months). A total of 147 scrotoplasties were carried out. Of the 147 total

scrotoplasty patients, 133 had labia majora flap scrotoplasty and perineal

reconstruction with single-stage phalloplasty. Distal flap necrosis

occurred in 6 patients (4.1 %); 5 were ipsilateral to the groin dissection

required for phalloplasty. Large (greater than 1 cm in diameter) perineo-

scrotal junction dehiscence occurred in 7 patients (4.7 %). All wounds

were managed conservatively except for 3 patients who developed

urethra-cutaneous fistulas at the perineo-scrotal junction. All 3 patients

required fistula repair; 2 (1.4 %) scrotal hematomas and 3 (2.0 %)

perineal hematomas were observed; all required operative intervention.

The authors concluded that labia majora flap scrotoplasty via the bilateral

rotational advancement technique and perineal reconstruction could be

safely carried out during phalloplasty. Minor wound complications were

common and often healed with conservative management. Wounds that

did not heal may be associated with urethral complications. Hematomas

were rare but usually required surgical intervention.

Fascelli et al (2023) noted that transgender and gender diverse (TGD)

individuals may seek gender-affirming phalloplasty with specific functional

objectives, including erectile function sufficient for penetrative sexual

intercourse. Individuals seeking penile prosthesis placement must accept

the potential risks to their phallic anatomy. These investigators examined

current practices at their center and conducted narrative review of

literature discussing techniques for penile prosthesis and testicular

prosthesis placement after phalloplasty and scrotoplasty, as well as

surgical outcomes, and QOL outcomes where available. Early discussion

of a staged approach to phallic construction with a last step of implant

placement is important during initial phalloplasty counseling. Pre-

operative counseling at the authors’ multi-disciplinary center includes:

discussion of surgical history, complications, goals and priorities; physical

examination to assess phallic size and position, scrotal size, as well as

other anatomic findings that may influence prosthesis selection; urinary

evaluation, including uroflowmetry with post-void residual (PVR), and a

cystoscopy with retrograde urethrogram if indicated based on symptoms

or urinary studies, and discussion of surgical risks, benefits and

alternatives. Although none of the commercially available penile

prosthesis devices in the U.S. is designed for phalloplasty, modern

inflatable and malleable prostheses are adapted for use in the post-

phalloplasty setting. Due to the lack of native corpora cavernosa, highly

variable phallic anatomy, and the need to adapt implants designed for

natal penile anatomy, complication rates of prosthesis placement after

phalloplasty remain high, with reported ranges of complications from 20

% to 80 %.

The authors concluded that major complications requiring surgical

revision are common relative to implant placement in natal penile

anatomy, and include: infection requiring explantation, device extrusion,

erosion, migration or malposition, inadequate rigidity, poor aesthetic

result, pain, decrease or loss of erogenous and/or tactile sensation,

device failure, injury to the urethra, and injury to the neurovascular supply

of the penis with resultant partial or complete flap loss. This broad range

of complication rates represented the variability with which results were

reported and reflected a lack of clear reporting guidelines, significant

variability in techniques, and need for more standardization. To optimize

outcomes, it is important that surgeons have an in-depth understanding of

phalloplasty anatomy and are equipped to manage potential

complications in the short- and long-term.

Saxena et al (2023) stated that while masculinizing gender-affirming

genital surgeries may include scrotoplasty, there has been limited

research on the safety and outcomes of scrotoplasty among transgender

men. These researchers compared scrotoplasty complication rates

between cisgender and transgender patients using data from the

American College of Surgeon's National Surgical Quality Improvement

Program (NSQIP) data-base. Data were queried between 2013 and 2019

for all patients with procedure codes for scrotoplasty. Transgender

patients were identified via a gender dysphoria diagnosis code; t-tests

and Fisher's exact test were employed to identify any differences in

demographics, operative characteristics, and outcomes. The primary

outcomes of interest were demographic factors, operative details, and

surgical outcomes. A total of 234 patients were identified between 2013

and 2019 – 50 were transgender and 184 were cisgender. Age and BMI

were significantly different between the 2 cohorts, such that the cisgender

cohort was older (M trans = 38 years (SD:14), M cis = 53 years (SD: 15))

https://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/1_99/0031.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com

and had higher BMI than the transgender cohort (M trans = 26.9 (SD:

5.5), M cis = 35.2 (SD: 11.2)). Cisgender patients also had poorer overall

health (p = 0.001), and were more likely to have hypertension (p = 0.001)

and diabetes (p = 0.001). Race and ethnicity did not vary significantly

between the 2 cohorts. Operative details differed significantly between

cohorts, such that transgender patients had a longer operating time (M

trans = 303 mins (SD: 155), M cis = 147 mins (SD: 107)) and fewer

transgender patients had a simple scrotoplasty (p = 0.02). The majority

of gender-affirming scrotoplasties were carried out by plastic surgeons

(62 %) whereas the majority of cisgender scrotoplasties were carried out

by urologists (76 %). Despite these demographic and pre-operative

differences, the number of patients who underwent complex scrotoplasty

experiencing any of the tested complications did not differ by gender.

The authors concluded that these findings supported scrotoplasty as a

safe procedure for transgender patients, with no significant differences in

outcomes between transgender and cisgender patients.

Everett et al (2024) presented their technique for 2nd-stage scrotoplasty

with autologous tissue augmentation following gender-affirming

metoidioplasty. This technique augments the scrotum while removing the

upper labia majora and making the penis more visible and accessible.

This procedure avoids the need for testicular prostheses and their

potential for discomfort, displacement, extrusion, or infection. The

preliminary results show ed that the complication rate was low.

Elrouby (2024) noted that the PSW may be congenital or acquired

following excessive ventral skin removal during circumcision. Several

surgical techniques were described for the treatment of congenital

webbed penis without a clear comparison between their outcomes. In a

prospective study, these investigators compared the surgical results of Z-

scrotoplasty and Heineke-Mikulicz scrotoplasty in the treatment of

congenital webbed penis in uncircumcised pediatric patients. This trial

included 40 uncircumcised patients who were divided randomly into 2

groups: Group A included 20 patients who were treated by Z-scrotoplasty;

and Group B included the other 20 patients who were treated by Heineke-

Mikulicz scrotoplasty. All patients were circumcised at the end of the

procedure. The age at operation ranged between 6 months and 6 years

with an average of 29.9 ± 17.45 months. The authors concluded that

treatment of congenital PSW in the pediatric age group could be done

with either Z-scrotoplasty or Heineke-Mikulicz scrotoplasty with

satisfactory results; however, without significant difference in the surgical

outcomes.
