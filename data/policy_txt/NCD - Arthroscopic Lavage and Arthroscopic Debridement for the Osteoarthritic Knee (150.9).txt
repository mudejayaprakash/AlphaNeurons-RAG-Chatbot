NCD - Arthroscopic Lavage and Arthroscopic Debridement for the Osteoarthritic Knee (150.9)

Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the direct visualization of the interior joint

space. In addition to providing visualization, arthroscopy enables the process of joint

cleansing through the use of lavage or irrigation. Lavage alone may involve either large or

small volume saline irrigation of the knee by arthroscopy. Although generally performed to

reduce pain and improve function, current practice does not recognize the beneﬁt of lavage

alone for the reduction of mechanical symptoms. Arthroscopy also permits the removal of

any loose bodies from the interior joint space, a procedure termed debridement.

Debridement, when used alone or not otherwise speciﬁed, may include low volume lavage

or washout. Osteoarthritis is a chronic and painful joint disease caused by degeneration.

The American College of Rheumatology deﬁnes a patient diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the

knee as presenting with pain, and meeting at least 5 of the following criteria:

Over 50 years of age;

Less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness;

Crepitus (noisy, grating sound) on active motion; Bony tenderness; Bony enlargement; No palpable warmth of synovium;

ESR <40mm/hr;

Rheumatoid Factor <1:40; or, Synovial ﬂuid signs.

Indications and Limitations of Coverage

A. Nationally Covered Indications

Not applicable.

B. Nationally Noncovered Indications

The clinical effectiveness of arthroscopic lavage and arthroscopic debridement for the severe osteoarthritic knee has not been veriﬁed by scientiﬁcally controlled studies. After

thorough discussions with clinical investigators, the orthopedic community, and other interested parties, CMS determines that the following procedures are not considered

reasonable or necessary in treatment of the osteoarthritic knee and are not covered by the

Medicare program:

Arthroscopic lavage used alone for the osteoarthritic knee; Arthroscopic debridement for osteoarthritic patients presenting with knee pain only; or,

Arthroscopic debridement and lavage with or without debridement for patients

presenting with severe osteoarthritis (Severe osteoarthritis is deﬁned in the Outerbridge classiﬁcation scale, grades III and IV. Outerbridge is the most commonly used clinical

scale that classiﬁes the severity of joint degeneration of the knee by compartments and

grades. Grade I is deﬁned as softening or blistering of joint cartilage. Grade II is deﬁned as fragmentation or ﬁssuring in an area <1 cm. Grade III presents clinically with

cartilage fragmentation or ﬁssuring in an area >1 cm. Grade IV refers to cartilage

erosion down to the bone. Grades III and IV are characteristic of severe osteoarthritis.)

C. Other

Apart from the noncovered indications above for arthroscopic lavage and/or arthroscopic

debridement of the osteoarthritic knee, all other indications of debridement for the subpopulation of patients without severe osteoarthritis of the knee who present with

symptoms other than pain alone; i.e., (1) mechanical symptoms that include, but are not limited to, locking, snapping, or popping (2) limb and knee joint alignment, and (3) less

severe and/or early degenerative arthritis, remain at local contractor discretion. Medicare contractors may require submission of one or all of the following documents to deﬁne the

patient’s knee condition:

Operative notes,

Reports of standing x-rays, or, Arthroscopy results.
