NCD - Deep Brain Stimulation for Essential Tremor and Parkinson’s Disease (160.24)

Effective for services furnished on or after April 1, 2003, Medicare will cover unilateral or

bilateral thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the

treatment of essential tremor (ET) and/or Parkinsonian tremor and unilateral or bilateral

subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi) DBS for the treatment of

Parkinson's disease (PD) only under the following conditions:

1. Medicare will only consider DBS devices to be reasonable and necessary if they are

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved devices for DBS or devices used in

accordance with FDA approved protocols governing Category B Investigational Device

Exemption (IDE) DBS clinical trials.

2. For thalamic VIM DBS to be considered reasonable and necessary, patients must meet

all of the following criteria:

a. Diagnosis of ET based on postural or kinetic tremors of hand(s) without other

neurologic signs, or diagnosis of idiopathic PD (presence of at least 2 cardinal PD

features (tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia)) which is of a tremor-dominant form. b. Marked disabling tremor of at least level 3 or 4 on the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Tremor Rating Scale (or equivalent scale) in the extremity intended for treatment, causing signiﬁcant limitation in daily activities despite optimal medical therapy.

c. Willingness and ability to cooperate during conscious operative procedure, as well

as during post-surgical evaluations, adjustments of medications and stimulator settings.

3. For STN or GPi DBS to be considered reasonable and necessary, patients must meet all

of the following criteria:

a. Diagnosis of PD based on the presence of at least 2 cardinal PD features (tremor,

rigidity or bradykinesia).

b. Advanced idiopathic PD as determined by the use of Hoehn and Yahr stage or Uniﬁed Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III motor subscale.

c. L-dopa responsive with clearly deﬁned "on" periods.

d. Persistent disabling Parkinson's symptoms or drug side effects (e.g., dyskinesias, motor ﬂuctuations, or disabling "off" periods) despite optimal medical therapy.

e. Willingness and ability to cooperate during conscious operative procedure, as well as during post-surgical evaluations, adjustments of medications and stimulator

settings.

The DBS is not reasonable and necessary and is not covered for ET or PD patients with any

of the following:

1. Non-idiopathic Parkinson's disease or "Parkinson's Plus" syndromes. 2. Cognitive impairment, dementia or depression, which would be worsened by or would

interfere with the patient's ability to beneﬁt from DBS.

3. Current psychosis, alcohol abuse or other drug abuse.

4. Structural lesions such as basal ganglionic stroke, tumor or vascular malformation as

etiology of the movement disorder.

5. Previous movement disorder surgery within the affected basal ganglion.

6. Signiﬁcant medical, surgical, neurologic or orthopedic co-morbidities contraindicating

DBS surgery or stimulation.

Patients who undergo DBS implantation should not be exposed to diathermy (deep heat treatment including shortwave diathermy, microwave diathermy and ultrasound diathermy)

or any type of MRI, which may adversely affect the DBS system or adversely affect the brain around the implanted electrodes.

The DBS should be performed with extreme caution in patients with cardiac pacemakers or other electronically controlled implants, which may adversely affect or be affected by the

DBS system.

For DBS lead implantation to be considered reasonable and necessary, providers and

facilities must meet all of the following criteria:

Neurosurgeons must:

a. Be properly trained in the procedure;

b. Have experience with the surgical management of movement disorders, including DBS

therapy; and

c. Have experience performing stereotactic neurosurgical procedures.

Operative teams must have training and experience with DBS systems, including knowledge

of anatomical and neurophysiological characteristics for localizing the targeted nucleus, surgical and/or implantation techniques for the DBS system, and operational and functional

characteristics of the device.

Physicians specializing in movement disorders must be involved in both patient selection

and post-procedure care.

Hospital medical centers must have:

a. Brain imaging equipment (MRI and/or CT) for pre-operative stereotactic localization and

targeting of the surgical site(s);

b. Operating rooms with all necessary equipment for stereotactic surgery; and c. Support services necessary for care of patients undergoing this procedure and any

potential complications arising intraoperatively or postoperatively.
