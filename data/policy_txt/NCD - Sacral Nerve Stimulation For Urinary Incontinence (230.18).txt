stimulation involves both a temporary test stimulation to determine if an implantable

stimulator would be effective and a permanent implantation in appropriate candidates. Both

the test and the permanent implantation are covered.

The following limitations for coverage apply to all three indications:

Patient must be refractory to conventional therapy (documented behavioral,

pharmacologic and/or surgical corrective therapy) and be an appropriate surgical

candidate such that implantation with anesthesia can occur.

Patients with stress incontinence, urinary obstruction, and speciﬁc neurologic diseases

(e.g., diabetes with peripheral nerve involvement) which are associated with secondary

manifestations of the above three indications are excluded.

Patient must have had a successful test stimulation in order to support subsequent

implantation. Before a patient is eligible for permanent implantation, he/she must

demonstrate a 50% or greater improvement through test stimulation. Improvement is measured through voiding diaries. Patient must be able to demonstrate adequate ability to record voiding diary data such

that clinical results of the implant procedure can be properly evaluated.
