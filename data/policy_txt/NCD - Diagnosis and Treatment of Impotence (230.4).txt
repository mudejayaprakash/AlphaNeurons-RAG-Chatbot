NCD - Diagnosis and Treatment of Impotence (230.4)

Impotence is a failure of a body part for which the diagnosis, and frequently the treatment,

require medical expertise. Depending on the cause of the condition, treatment may be

surgical; e.g., implantation of a penile prosthesis, or nonsurgical; e.g., medical or

psychotherapeutic treatment.

Indications and Limitations of Coverage

Program payment may be made for diagnosis and treatment of sexual impotence. Since

causes and, therefore, appropriate treatment vary, if abuse is suspected it may be necessary

to request documentation of appropriateness in individual cases. If treatment is furnished to

patients (other than hospital inpatients) in connection with a mental condition, apply the

psychiatric service limitation described in the Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and

Entitlement Manual

, Chapter 3.
