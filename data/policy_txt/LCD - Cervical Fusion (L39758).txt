Provider Qualiﬁcations

The Medicare Program Integrity Manual states services will be considered reasonable and necessary only if performed by appropriately trained providers.

Patient safety and quality of care mandate that healthcare professionals who perform cervical fusion are appropriately trained and credentialed by a formal residency/fellowship program. Credentialing or privileges are required for procedures performed in inpatient and outpatient settings.

All aspects of care must be within the provider’s medical licensure and scope of practice. Reimbursement for procedures utilizing imaging techniques may be made to providers who meet training requirements for the procedures in this policy only if their respective state allows such in their practice act and formally licenses or certiﬁes the practitioner to use and interpret these imaging modalities (ionizing radiation and associated contrast material, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound). At a minimum, training must cover and develop an understanding of anatomy and drug pharmacodynamics and kinetics as well as proﬁciency in diagnosis and management of disease, the technical performance of the procedure, and utilization of the required associated imaging modalities.

Notice: Services performed for any given diagnosis must meet all the indications and limitations stated in this LCD, the general requirements for medical necessity as stated in CMS payment policy manuals, all existing CMS national coverage determinations, and all Medicare payment rules.

A Multi-MAC Contractor Advisory Committee (CAC) Meeting was hosted by Noridian and included Noridian Healthcare Solutions, CGS Administrators, National Government Services, Palmetto GBA, WPS Government Health Administrators, First Coast Service Options and Novitas Solutions on August 16, 2023. The transcript and audio for this meeting is posted on each MACs website. Feedback from the subject matter experts is included through the evidence summary.

Summary of Evidence

Conservative Treatment

Treatment of cervical radiculopathy can range from conservative management to surgery. Conservative care is considered initial management for cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders as most cases will be self-limited and resolve spontaneously over a variable length of time without speciﬁc intervention. Conservative management for cervical radiculopathy may include oral analgesics or short course of oral glucocorticoids, avoidance of provocative activities, short term immobilization with cervical collar or pillow, active physical In a published analysis of clinical practice therapy, manual therapy, and cervical traction. guidelines for neck pain and radiculopathy the following interventions were listed as 16 recommended components of conservative therapy :

15,16

Pharmacotherapies: analgesics, Paracetamol (Acetaminophen), NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs), SNRIS, opioids (including tramadol), topical medications including NSAIDS. Non-Pharmacologic Interventions: exercise programs/physical therapy, thermotherapy, manual therapy (combined with other treatment), acupuncture, epidural steroid injection.

Studies have shown that surgery and conservative interventions achieve similar long-term results, and that conservative treatment is often the preferred option because it avoids the risks of surgical treatment. the role of conservative measures as a ﬁrst-line approach for the management of cervical radiculopathy. improve with conservative measures. was shown to be beneﬁcial for cervical radiculopathy in a systematic review and meta- analysis. randomized trial to substantially reduce neck and arm pain for patients with cervical A RCT compared cervical collar or physical therapy and found improvement radiculopathy. over a wait and see approach suggesting that an active treatment approach results in better outcomes. cervical radiculopathy had more rapid resolution of symptoms compared to those who remained in physical therapy but outcomes at 2 years were similar and conclude structured physiotherapy should be considered ﬁrst line management.

26

While the focus was on

Different deﬁnitions of conservative care are used e.g., “a multimodality approach consisting of a combination of active and inactive components” and “a combination of strategies to reduce inﬂammation, alleviate pain, and improve function.” All organizations require the failure of at least six weeks of conservative management.

Some organizations require conservative management within the preceding 3 or 6 months,

while others do not specify how recently conservative treatment needs to take place.

Conservative interventions are ‘provider-directed treatment’ that includes education,

activity modiﬁcation, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory (NSAIDs), narcotic and non-narcotic

analgesic medications, oral or injectable corticosteroids, a provider-directed home

exercise/stretching program, cross-training, avoidance of aggravating activities,

physical/occupational therapy, spinal manipulation, interventional pain procedure, and

other pain management techniques. Only a single organization requires two separate forms

of conservative treatment, although the guidelines do not specify what these are.

Imaging Modalities

North American Spine Society (NASS) Evidence-Based Clinical Guidelines on the Diagnosis

and Treatment for Cervical Radiculopathy from Degenerative Disorders state MRI is the

recommended study for correlative compressive lesions in cervical spine patients who have

failed conservative therapy and being considered for intervention based on Grade B

recommendation. The consensus of the group was that CT can be considered in those who

have a contraindication to MRI. Computed tomography myelography was recommended for

patients with discordant ﬁndings on MRI or contraindication to MRI based on Grade B

Recommendation. There was insufﬁcient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the

use of electromyography (EMG) for cervical radiculopathy evaluation.

Cervical Radiculopathy

Cervical radiculopathy is a common condition that usually occurs when a nerve root is inﬂamed

by a herniated disc or bone spur. As a result, the inﬂamed nerve root may result in neck pain,

numbness or muscle weakness and sensory symptoms. This condition impacts approximately

27

85 out of 100,000 people.

Clinical Outcomes

Seven evidence syntheses with publication dates ranging from 2016-2022 that assessed

28-34

28,30

clinical outcomes were identiﬁed.

Two reviews included only RCTs.

Four studies

included both non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) and a small number (range 1-6)

29,31-33

of RCTs.

The number of primary studies in the syntheses ranged from 7-23, with

generally small sample sizes. Half the studies diagnosed participants with single-level,

unilateral cervical radiculopathy. Comparators included different fusion techniques,

foraminotomy, arthroplasty, and conservative interventions. Anterior cervical discectomy and

fusion was an intervention in each study. Timing to follow-up ranged from 24 to 47 months.

Broekema, et al. (2020)conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis that included 1,567

28

participants described in 21 RCTs.

Thirteen of the studies had data from less than 100

participants. The clinical effects of ACDF were compared with posterior cervical foraminotomy

(PCF), anterior cervical discectomy without intervertebral spacer (ACD), ACD with poly-

methylmethacrylate as an intervertebral spacer (PMMA), autologous bone graft (ABG), ACDF

with autologous bone graft plus plating (ABGP), cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA), and physical

therapy. ACDF had a signiﬁcantly better success rate compared to ACD. Among the remaining

comparisons, there were no signiﬁcant differences in success rates. Six subgroup comparisons

found no signiﬁcant differences in work status across interventions. Aside from a signiﬁcant

effect favoring ACDF over CDA, there were no differences in disability outcomes at mean

follow-up. Improvement in arm pain favored ACDF with a cage over ABGP, ACD over ACDF

with a cage, and ACDF over CDA. The clinical signiﬁcance of these differences was not

described. Limitations in this evidence synthesis included an overall high risk of bias (only 3 of

21 included studies had a low risk of bias), indirectness (the mean age across studies was 43.8 years), and imprecision due to the small sample sizes across sizes, with 62% of studies having

less than 100 participants.

Fang, et al. (2020) included 3 RCTs and 12 NRSI with a total of 52,705 (~51K from a single

cohort study) participants diagnosed with single-level unilateral cervical radiculopathy in a

systematic review with meta-analysis. Outcomes comparing ACDF with PCF were measured at

a mean of 47 months. No statistically signiﬁcant differences were identiﬁed for measures of disability (function), neck pain, arm pain, or satisfaction. Limitations impacting the certainty of

the evidence included inherent drawbacks due to most of the primary study designs (12 of 15

studies were retrospective cohort designs) and the 3 RCTs either did not contribute to or

contributed minimally to the pooled analyses, indirectness (the mean ages across studies

ranged from 39 to 53.8 years), and signiﬁcant heterogeneity was observed in subgroup

analyses of ACDF vs. PCF using open and minimally invasive techniques.

In a network meta-analysis, Gao, et al. (2022) performed direct and indirect comparisons of

30

ABG, ACD, ACF, PCF, ACDFP (ACDF plus plating), CDA, PMMA, and physical therapy.

three RCTs (N=1,844) were assessed at a mean of 26 months. There were no statistical

differences among the different interventions in measures of success rate, arm/neck pain, or

disability. There were limitations in this network meta-analysis including an overall high risk of

bias (only 13% [3 of 23] of the studies had a low risk of bias), indirectness (the mean/median age among the included studies ranged from 41 to 50.5 years and only 2 of 23 studies were

conducted within the United States), imprecision (sample sizes were small [27-209]), and

inconsistency (clinical and statistical heterogeneity).

Goedmakers, et al. (2020) systematically reviewed 6 RCTs and 2 NRSI (N=777) in comparing

31

ACDF with CDA.

Timing to follow-up in the studies ranged from 1-7 years. A single study

reported a statistically signiﬁcant difference between interventions for disability; however, the difference did not achieve clinical relevance. Another ﬁve studies found no signiﬁcant difference

between CDA and ACDF. None of the studies reported a signiﬁcant difference in neck pain after

2 years post-surgery. Limitations of this systematic review included all articles showed

intermediate to high risk of bias, indirectness (mean age was ~45 years), imprecision (sample

sizes were small [41-209]), and inconsistency (high heterogeneity precluded pooling the results

of individual studies).

A systematic review with meta-analysis of 658 patients (1 RCT; 11 NRSI) with single-level

32

cervical radiculopathy compared traditional ACDF vs. stand-alone ACDF vs. CDA.

The

reviewers found no statistically signiﬁcant differences in disability measures at a minimum of 1

year for the different interventions. Limitations included the drawbacks inherent in

observational studies (11 of 12 included studies were cohort designs), uncertainty about the

internal validity of the studies (risk of bias of the included studies was not assessed),

imprecision (the mean sample size was 54.8), and inconsistency (high heterogeneity was

present in the pooled analysis for disability outcomes).

Liu, et al. (2016) produced a systematic review of 1,336 patients with cervical radiculopathy (3

33

RCTs, 7 NRSI) who underwent either ACDF or PCF.

At a mean of 3.7 years following the

procedure, there were no between-group differences in patient-reported measures of pain and

disability. Based on a single study, ACDF showed a signiﬁcantly higher success rate (93.6%)

than the PCF group (85.1%). Limitations of this review included the drawbacks inherent in

observational studies (7 of the 10 studies were retrospective cohort designs), all the RCTs were

judged to have a high risk of bias, and indirectness (the mean age of the included participants

was ~46 years [39-53.3]).

Zou, et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review with a meta-analysis of 1,175 patients with

34

unilateral cervical radiculopathy.

One RCT and 6 NRSI compared clinical outcomes for groups

receiving ACDF or MI-PCF (minimally invasive posterior cervical fusion). At a mean post-surgical

follow-up of 47 months, no statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed in patient-

reported disability, neck pain, or arm pain. Limitations in this evidence synthesis included those

inherent in observational study designs, indirectness (the mean age of the participants was

48.9 years), and inconsistency (high heterogeneity was reported for arm pain outcomes).

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)

In aggregate, the clinical effects associated with the different surgical and conservative interventions did not result in statistically signiﬁcant or clinically relevant differences. The only

exception was ACDF, which showed a better success rate than ACD. Overall, the certainty of

the evidence was determined to be very low. Limitations included those inherent in

observational study designs, high risk of bias in most RCTs, indirectness, imprecision, and

heterogeneous outcomes.

Surgical Outcomes

Three evidence syntheses reported on perioperative measures. Operative time was assessed in

29,30,34

29,34

all studies.

Length of stay (LOS) was included in two reviews.

A single study

29

analyzed blood loss.

Fang, et al. (2020) compared ACDF with open PCF or MI-PCF for patients with single-level,

29

unilateral cervical radiculopathy in a systematic review with meta-analysis.

The reviewers

reported that compared to ACDF, open PCF had a shorter operation time, while there was no

difference between ACDF and MI-PCF. Based on data from 2 studies, there was no signiﬁcant

difference in blood loss among the surgical techniques. The PCF group was associated with a

signiﬁcantly shorter length of hospitalization than the ACDF group. Limitations impacting the

certainty of the evidence included inherent drawbacks due to most of the primary study designs

(12 of 15 studies were retrospective cohort designs) and the 3 RCTs either did not contribute to

or contributed minimally to the pooled analyses, indirectness (the mean ages across studies ranged from 39 to 53.8 years), and signiﬁcant heterogeneity was observed in subgroup

analyses of ACDF vs. PCF using open and minimally invasive techniques.

Gao, et al. (2022) assessed operative time for different surgical procedures in a network meta-

30

analysis.

Direct and indirect comparisons showed ABGP, ACD, ACDF, and ACDFP had shorter

surgery times compared with ABG. ACDF had a shorter surgery time compared with PMMA.

There were limitations in this network meta-analysis including an overall high risk of bias (only 13% [3 of 23] of the studies had a low risk of bias), indirectness (the mean/median age among

the included studies ranged from 41 to 50.5 years and only 2 of 23 studies were conducted

within the United States), imprecision (sample sizes were small [27-209]), and inconsistency

(clinical and statistical heterogeneity).

Zou, et al. (2022) performed a systematic review with meta-analysis comparing ACDF with MI-

34

PCF. cohorts. Data from 3 retrospective studies observed a statistically signiﬁcant difference in LOS

The analysis did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant difference in operative time between the two

favoring MI-PCF. Limitations in this evidence synthesis included those inherent in observational

study designs, and indirectness (the mean age of the participants was 48.9 years).

In summary, the observed perioperative results varied by the comparators and the type of

outcome. Compared to open PCF, ACDF had signiﬁcantly longer operative time and LOS. MI-

PCF also had a signiﬁcantly less LOS than ACDF. When ACDF was compared to other surgical techniques, no signiﬁcant differences were found in operative time and blood loss. The overall

15/52

10/15/25, 7:00 PM

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)

certainty of the evidence was rated as very low due to the high risk of bias in the included RCTs,

limitations inherent in observational studies, and uncertainty about the applicability of the

results to the U.S. Medicare population (indirectness).

Radiographic Outcomes

Two evidence syntheses described post-surgical radiographic results associated with

32,33

individuals diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy.

Katsuura, et al. (2019) performed a systematic review with meta-analysis that compared

32

traditional ACDF vs. stand-alone ACDF vs. CDA.

At a minimum of 1-year post-surgical follow-

up, no signiﬁcant differences in the C2-C7 (Cobb) angle were observed. Limitations of this

evidence synthesis included the drawbacks inherent in observational studies (11 of 12 included

studies were cohort designs), uncertainty about the internal validity of the studies (risk of bias

of the included studies was not assessed), and imprecision (the mean sample size was 54.8).

Liu, et al. (2016) systematically reviewed data from 3 RCTs and 7 NRSI, encompassing 1,335

33

patients; however, only a single RCT provided data regarding radiographic outcomes.

The

postoperative ROM of the caudal adjacent segment was 11.33° ± 5.07° in the ACDF group and

8.73° ± 5.92° in the PCF group. The signiﬁcance of this difference was not described. Limitations

of this review included the drawbacks inherent in observational studies (seven of the ten studies

were retrospective cohort designs), all the RCTs were judged to have a high risk of bias, and

indirectness (the mean age of the included participants was ~46 years [39-53.3]).

Overall, there was limited evidence concerning radiographic outcomes following cervical fusion

in patients diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy. No signiﬁcant between-group differences

were reported for Cobb angle or ROM. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged as very

low due to a high/unknown risk of bias, study design limitations, imprecise data, and

indirectness.

Undesirable Effects

Six evidence syntheses described undesired effects associated with cervical fusion

28,30,31,33-35

surgery.

Assessment timeframes ranged from 24 to 57 months.

Broekema, et al. (2020) performed a systematic review with meta-analysis of 1,567

participants diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy who underwent anterior or posterior

28

surgical interventions and were compared with other surgical techniques.

There was a higher

complication rate in the group with ABG from the iliac crest. This effect disappeared when

donor-site complications were left out. No other signiﬁcant effect was observed in the

comparison between ACDF with ABG and ACDF with a cage. Subgroup comparisons found no

signiﬁcant differences in reoperation rate across the different surgeries. Limitations in this

evidence synthesis included an overall high risk of bias (only 3 of 21 included studies had a low

risk of bias), indirectness (the mean age across studies was 43.8 years), and imprecision due to

the small sample sizes across sizes, with 62% of studies having less than 100 participants.

10/15/25, 7:00 PM

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)

Gao, et al. (2022) conducted a network meta-analysis of 23 RCTs that included direct and

indirect comparisons of ACDF, ABG, ACD, ACF, PCF, ACDFP, CDA, PMMA, and physical

30

therapy.

There were no statistical differences among the various interventions, including

physical therapy for complication and reoperation rates. There were limitations in this network

meta-analysis including an overall high risk of bias (only 13% [3 of 23] of the studies had a low

risk of bias), indirectness (the mean/median age among the included studies ranged from 41 to

50.5 years and only 2 of 23 studies were conducted within the United States), imprecision

(sample sizes were small [27-209]), and inconsistency (clinical and statistical heterogeneity).

Goedmakers, et al. (2020) systematically reviewed 777 participants with cervical radiculopathy

31

from 6 RCTs and 2 NRSI in comparing CDA to ACDF.

The authors concluded the reporting on

the level of reoperation is heterogeneous and incomplete; however, the results suggested

reoperations were most frequent at the adjacent level for the ACDF group and at the index level

for the CDA group. Four articles described adjacent segment disease (ASD), of which only one

article described a signiﬁcantly higher incidence of ASD in ACDF patients. No other statistically

signiﬁcant differences in complication rates were described between groups. Limitations of this

systematic review included all articles showed intermediate to high risk of bias, indirectness

(mean age was ~45 years), imprecision (sample sizes were small [41-209]), and inconsistency

(high heterogeneity precluded pooling the results of individual studies).

Gutman, et al. (2018) performed a systematic review with meta-analysis that focused on the

comparative undesired effects of participants with single-level cervical radiculopathy who

35

prospectively underwent ACDF, CDA, or MI-PCF.

The rate of revision surgery following ACDF

(14.46) was greater than double that of MI-PCF (7.00) and CDR (6.49). Compared to ACDF

(21.29), the rate of adverse events was signiﬁcantly less for MI-PCF (3.00), but greater for CDA

(27.27). Limitation in this review included the risk of bias of the primary studies was not

assessed, indirectness (the mean age for each of the included studies was less than 50 years

[43-49.3]), imprecision (the number of studies was few [4], with small sample sizes), and

uncertainty concerning inconsistency (heterogeneity was not assessed).

Liu, et al. (2016) assessed the overall complication rate in a systematic review that compared

33

patients who had received either ACDF or PCF.

The mean complication rate was 7% in the

ACDF group and 4% in the PCF group. The difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.

Limitations of this review included the drawbacks inherent in observational studies (seven of the

ten studies were retrospective cohort designs), all the RCTs were judged to have a high risk of

bias, and indirectness (the mean age of the included participants was ~46 years [39-53.3]).

Zou, et al. (2022) employed a systematic review with meta-analysis of 1,175 patients who

34

underwent either ACDF or PCF.

In the ACDF group, complication rates ranged between 1.8%

and 10.5%. In the MIS-PCF group, the rate was between 0% and 14.3%. The between-group

difference was not signiﬁcant. The reoperation rate was between 0-7.5% in the ACDF group

and 0 -14.3% in the MIS-PCF group. The difference was not signiﬁcant. Limitations in this

17/52

10/15/25, 7:00 PM

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)

evidence synthesis included those inherent in observational study designs, and indirectness (the

mean age of the participants was 48.9 years).

In aggregate, the complication rates associated with different surgical procedures and physical

therapy are generally similar; however, the rate of adverse events with ACDF appears to be

greater than MI-PCF, and the rate of ASD is lower with CDA vs. ACDF. The overall results of the

different evidence syntheses were heterogeneous concerning reoperation rates. No signiﬁcant

differences were found among the surgical interventions studied apart from a small systematic

review (Gutman, et al.; 2018) that concluded the revision surgery rate of ACDF was double that

of CDA and MI-PCF. The credibility of these ﬁndings was very low due to a lack of quality

appraisal (risk of bias) for the included RCTs, the small numbers of studies (4) and participants

(506), uncertain applicability to the U.S. Medicare population, and omitting an assessment of

heterogeneity. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low due to multiple

limitations i.e., study designs, high/unclear risk of bias, indirectness, imprecise results, and

unexplained heterogeneity.

Societal Input

The North American Spine Society (NASS) has published appropriateness criteria for cervical

3

fusion surgery as a treatment for cervical radiculopathy.

Cervical radiculopathy: from degenerative disorders (either from disc herniation or bony

stenosis), as an adjunct to disc excision, that meets ALL the following criteria:

Pattern of radiculopathy explained by imaging.

Six to 12 weeks of an appropriate course of nonoperative treatment.

The following can mitigate the need for an initial nonoperative trial:

Severity of symptoms prevents the patient from working. Functionally limiting motor weakness.

Cervical fusion may NOT be indicated in cases that do not fulﬁll the above criteria including

cervical radiculopathy from isolated foraminal stenosis treated with a partial medial

facetectomy/foraminotomy.

Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy

Clinical Outcomes

Six evidence syntheses with publication dates ranging from 2014-2022 that assessed clinical

36-41

outcomes were identiﬁed.

Three of the syntheses included only non-randomized studies of

37,39,40

an intervention (NRSI).

Three studies included both NRSI and a small number (1-4) of

36,38,41

RCTs.

The number of primary studies in the syntheses ranged from 5-18, with generally

small sample sizes. Participants were mostly diagnosed with multilevel cervical spondylotic

myelopathy (CSM). Comparators included different fusion techniques, arthroplasty, and hybrid

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)

surgery. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was an intervention in each study. Timing to

follow-up was variable (1-60+ months).

Fei, et al. (2015) conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis that compared two fusion

36

techniques, ACDF and ACCF (anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion).

Eighteen primary

studies (1 RCT, 17 NRSI) were included in the review. Outcomes were assessed at a minimum of

6 months post-operation. Neurological status (success) and pain intensity outcomes were

similar between surgical groups. There were several limitations in this study including those

associated with observational studies (17 of 18 studies were cohort or case-control designs),

indirectness (17 of 18 studies included participants located in China or South Korea, and all the

studies had a mean/median between 32-59 years), imprecision (all studies had small sample

sizes with conﬁdence intervals that crossed the indicator for no effect), and inconsistency of

effects across studies (signiﬁcant heterogeneity for all secondary outcomes).

In a systematic review with meta-analysis, Han, et al. (2014) reported on 14 NRSI that

37

compared ACDF and ACCF.

At a postoperative minimum of 24 months, all clinical measures

(success rate, neurological status, pain, and function [disability]) were statistically similar (p

>0.05). Limitations of this review involved the inclusion of only low-quality studies (all included

studies were observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness (mean ages ranged

from 44-58.74 yrs.), imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes and pain outcomes had

small numbers of pooled data), and high statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency) was present

for functional outcomes.

38

Li, et al. (2019) performed a network meta-analysis that included 4 RCTs and 12 NRSI.

The

analysis included direct and indirect comparisons of ACDF, ACCF, cervical disc arthroplasty

[replacement] (CDA), and hybrid surgery. At a mean of 33.3 months following surgery, CDA

demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant difference in disability outcomes compared to the other

surgical procedures. The clinical signiﬁcance of these results was not described. Limitations in

this network meta-analysis were associated with low-quality studies (12 of 16 studies were

case-control designs), indirectness (indirect comparisons were a core component of the

methodology and 14 studies took place in Asia [China, South Korea, Singapore]), and imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes).

Montano, et al. (2019) systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed 5 NRSI (487 participants)

39

with multilevel CSM.

No difference in neurological status was found between ACDF and

laminoplasty at a mean of 35.4 months post-surgery (MD = -0.053; 95% CI, -0.511 to 0.404; p =

0.819). Limitations involved the low-quality of all included studies (observational cohort or

case-control designs), indirectness (all studies had mean ages between 54 and 56.8 years.), imprecision (too few events for all outcomes and wide conﬁdence intervals for all pooled

outcomes measured).

A systematic review without meta-analysis of 11 primary studies (2 RCTs, 9 NRSI) included a

41

total of 570 participants with single or multilevel CSM.

Clinical outcomes were assessed

between 12 and 60 months postoperatively. No statistically signiﬁcant differences in ACDF and

19/52

10/15/25, 7:00 PM

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)

ACCF were found for neurological status, pain, or function (disability). Review limitations

included the overall low-quality primary study designs (9 of the 11 included studies were

observational cohort or case-control), indirectness (none of the studies were performed in the

United States and all studies had a mean age between 46.8 and 57.7 years), imprecision (all the

2

studies had small sample sizes), and inconsistency (I test revealed high heterogeneity [>75%]

across studies for all outcomes).

Wang, et al. (2022) included 14 NRSI with wide variation in sample sizes (40-2188) that

40

comparatively assessed ACDF and ACCF.

There was no between-group difference in patient-

reported function; however, improvement in neurological status at 1-60+ months follow-up

favored ACDF (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.91; p = 0.02). Limitations involved the selection of

low-quality studies (all studies were retrospective observational cohorts or case-control

designs) and indirectness (11 of the studies were conducted in Asia [China, South Korea]).

Primary Studies

One RCT that was not included in any evidence synthesis was identiﬁed. El-Ghandour, et al.

(2020) compared ACDF with posterior laminectomy with or without fusion in the management

42

of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).

Sixty-eight patients (mean age 53 years) were

enrolled in a 1:1 randomized trial. Clinical outcomes were assessed after 1 year. There were

signiﬁcantly better outcomes in patient-reported disability (function) and pain scores in the

ACDF group compared to posterior surgical approaches. The Nurick myelopathy grading scale

showed a nonsigniﬁcant improvement with using the posterior approach. The authors noted

several methodologic limitations including a high risk of bias in the randomization process, small

sample size, and short-term follow-up.

In aggregate, clinical outcomes were found to be largely equivalent regardless of surgical

technique. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low due to limitations

inherent in the included study designs, indirectness (uncertainty about the applicability to the

US Medicare population), imprecision (variability within studies in the direction and clinical

relevance of effects), and inconsistencies across studies in the magnitude of effect.

Surgical Outcomes

36-

A total of seven evidence syntheses evaluated surgical (perioperative) outcome measures. 40,43,44

4,5

All syntheses included NRSI, while RCTs were represented in two reviews.

Sample

sizes were small, patients were diagnosed with multilevel CSM, comparisons were between

surgical interventions, and follow-up assessments were variable.

Fei, et al. (2015) reported on data from 1,246 patients included in 18 primary studies (1 RCT, 17

38

NRSI).

Compared to ACCF, patients who underwent ACDF had superior perioperative

outcomes (length of stay [LOS], operative time, and blood loss). Limitations included the

preponderance of low-quality studies (17 of 18 studies were of observational designs),

indirectness (17 of 18 studies included participants located in China or South Korea, and all the

https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?lcdid=39758

studies had a mean/median between 32-59 years), imprecision (all studies had small sample

sizes with conﬁdence intervals that crossed the indicator for no effect), and inconsistency

(signiﬁcant heterogeneity for all secondary outcomes).

37

Han, et al. (2014) included 15 NRSI (1,372 participants) in comparing ACDF and ACCF.

No

signiﬁcant difference in operative time was found (MD = -9.34, 95% CI = -42.99 to 24.31; p =

0.59). LOS (MD = -5.60, 95% CI = -7.09 to - 4.11; p<0.00001) and blood loss (MD = -151.35,

95% CI = -253.22 to -49.48; p = 0.004) were both less (better) in the ACDF group vs. the ACCF

group. Limitations involved the low-quality of all included studies (observational cohort or case-

control designs), indirectness (mean ages ranged from 44-58.74 years), imprecision (all studies

had small sample sizes), and inconsistency (high statistical heterogeneity was present for blood

loss and operative time).

A network meta-analysis that included 1,639 patients with multilevel CSM found that ACDF

resulted in a shorter operative time compared (directly and indirectly) to other surgical

38

techniques (ACCF, CDA, and hybrid surgery).

Limitations included low-quality studies (12 of

16 studies were case-control designs), indirectness (indirect comparisons were a core

component of the methodology, 14 studies took place in Asia [China, South Korea, Singapore],

and only a single study included a U.S. population), and imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes).

Montano, et al. (2019) compared the results of ACDF and laminoplasty in 5 NRSI (487

39

patients).

There was a statistically signiﬁcant difference favoring ACDF regarding blood loss

(MD = -131.381; 95% CI, -259.522 to -3.240; p = 0.044). No between-group difference was

seen in operative time (MD = -10.231; 95% CI, -58.612 to 38.149; p = 0.679). Limitations related

to the low-quality of included studies (all were observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness (all studies had mean ages between 54 and 56.8 years), imprecision (too few

events for all outcomes and wide conﬁdence intervals for all pooled outcomes measured), and

inconsistency (high heterogeneity involving operative time and blood loss).

A total of 5,249 patients from 14 NRSI provided data on surgical outcomes for a systematic

40

review with meta-analysis.

Compared to ACCF, blood loss was signiﬁcantly less in patients

that underwent ACDF (OR = -528.63, 95% CI: -586.86, -470.39; p < 0.00001). Operative time was comparable between the two surgical groups. Limitations were due to the low-quality of

the included studies (all studies were retrospective observational cohorts or case-control

designs) and indirectness (11 of the studies were conducted in Asia [China, South Korea]).

Xu, et al. (2017) pooled data from 6 NRSI (379 patients) in comparing ACDF with posterior

43

laminoplasty (LAMP).

No signiﬁcant differences between the two surgical groups were found

for operative time (MD = 32.81, 95% CI = -26.76 to 92.38; p = 0.28) and blood loss MD = -24.16, 95% CI = -174.47 to 126.15; p = 0.75). Limitations included the low-quality study designs (All

studies were retrospective observational cohorts or case-control), indirectness (all studies had

mean ages between 44.7 and 67 years), imprecision (data were derived from small studies with

wide conﬁdence intervals that crossed the indicator for no effect), and inconsistency (very high

unexplained heterogeneity).

A systematic review with meta-analysis of 669 participants (4 NRSI) assessed surgical

44

outcomes between ACDF and hybrid surgery.

Blood loss signiﬁcantly favored ACDF over

hybrid surgery (SMD = -30.29, 95% CI = -45.06, -15.52; p <.00001), while operative time was

similar. The limitations of this review involved the low-quality study designs (all studies were

retrospective observational cohorts or case-control designs), and indirectness (none of the

studies were performed in the United States, and the mean age among studies ranged from 46.1 to 54.36 years).

Primary Studies

One RCT that was not included in any evidence synthesis was identiﬁed. El-Ghandour, et al.

(2020) compared ACDF with posterior laminectomy with or without fusion in the management

42

of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).

Sixty-eight patients (mean age 53 years) were

enrolled in the 1:1 randomized trial. The mean operative dura tion was signiﬁcantly longer in the

ACDF group (p < 0.001). The mean hospital stay was signiﬁcantly longer in the posterior group

(p < 0.001). The authors noted several methodologic limitations including a high risk of bias in

the randomization process, small sample size, and short-term follow-up.

Overall, the observed perioperative results varied by the comparators and the type of outcome.

Compared to open PCF, ACDF had signiﬁcantly longer operative time and LOS. MI-PCF also had

a signiﬁcantly less LOS than ACDF. When ACDF was compared to other surgical techniques, no

signiﬁcant differences were found in operative time and blood loss. The overall certainty of the

evidence was rated as very low due to the high risk of bias in the included RCTs, limitations

inherent in observational studies, and uncertainty about the applicability of the results to the

U.S. Medicare population (indirectness).

Radiographic Outcomes

Five evidence syntheses included assessments of radiographic outcomes (fusion rate, range of

36,37,39,40

motion [ROM], alignment, and lordotic.

Fusion rate was recorded in a systematic review with meta-analysis of 18 primary studies (1

36

RCT, 17 NRSI).

After a minimum of 6 months post-surgery, the authors found the fusion rate

was 100% for patients that underwent ACDF and ACCF. Review limitations involved the low-

quality of selected studies (17 of 18 studies were of observational designs), indirectness (17 of

18 studies included participants located in China or South Korea, and all the studies had a

mean/median between 32-59 years), imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes with

conﬁdence intervals that crossed the indicator for no effect), and inconsistency (there was

signiﬁcant heterogeneity for all secondary outcomes except fusion rate).

In another systematic review with meta-analysis, Han, et al. (2014) also reported no difference

37

in fusion rates between ACDF and ACCF (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.34 to 4.11; p = 0.80).

and segmental angles were measured at a minimum of 24 months follow-up. ACDF showed

statistically signiﬁcant outcomes compared to ACCF. The limitations in this review included the

low-quality of the selected studies (all studies were observational cohort or case-control

designs), indirectness (mean ages ranged from 44-58.74 years), imprecision (all studies had

small sample sizes), and inconsistency (high statistical heterogeneity was present for fusion

rate and Cobb angle).

Montano, et al. (2019) conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis that compared

39

radiographic outcomes reported in 5 NRSI between ACDF and laminoplasty.

The Cobb angle

(cervical lordosis) results were signiﬁcantly better for the ACDF group (MD = 5.63; 95% CI,

1.663-8.469; p = 0.004), while ROM favored laminoplasty (MD = -5.399; 95% CI, -10.584 to

0.214; p = 0.041). Limitations included the low-quality of analyzed studies (all were

observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness (all studies had mean ages between

54 and 56.8 years) imprecision (too few events for all outcomes and wide conﬁdence intervals

for all pooled outcomes measured), and inconsistency (high heterogeneity involving cervical

lordosis and ROM.

A systematic review with meta-analysis of 14 NRSI (5,249 patients diagnosed with multilevel

CSM) reported statistically signiﬁcant results favoring ACDF versus ACCF in sagittal and

40

segmental angles, as well as fusion rate.

Limitations were due to the low-quality of the

included studies (all studies were retrospective observational cohorts or case-control designs)

and indirectness (11 of the studies were conducted in Asia [China, South Korea]).

44

Zhao, et al. (2018) evaluated the radiographic effects of ACDF compared to hybrid surgery.

The meta-analysis of 669 patients (4 NRSI) found no signiﬁcant differences in fusion rate and

C2-C7 (Cobb) angle at 24 to 38 months post-surgery. Review limitations included the low-

quality of the selected studies (all were retrospective observational cohorts or case-control

designs), indirectness (none of the studies were performed in the United States and the mean

age among studies ranged from 46.1 to 54.36 years), imprecision (wide conﬁdence angles that

represented variable outcomes were found in the pooled data fusion rate), and inconsistency

(heterogeneity of effects in the pooled analyses for C2-C7 angle and fusion rate).

In aggregate, radiographic outcomes – obtained at variable time points – showed equitable or

favorable results in fusion rate, angular measurements, and alignment for ACDF compared to

ACCF, laminoplasty, and hybrid surgery. Laminoplasty was superior to ACDF in preserving

ROM. The certainty of the evidence was determined to be very low due to the types of included

study designs (mostly retrospective NRSI), uncertainty about the generalizability to the U.S. Medicare population, imprecise results, and heterogeneity of ﬁndings.

Undesirable Effects

Six evidence syntheses provided ﬁndings regarding a range of undesirable effects associated

36-40,44

with cervical fusion surgeries.

Four reviews focused on the total or overall complication

https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?lcdid=39758

23/52

36-39

rate.

In addition to the total complication rate, two syntheses detailed the results of a range

40,44

of undesirable effects.

Fei, et al. (2015) reported that the total complication rate was signiﬁcantly lower for individuals

36

with ACDF than ACCF (RR= 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.80; p = 0.003).

This result was based on a

meta-analysis of 1,246 patients, with a minimum of 6 months follow-up. Limitation of this

evidence synthesis were the low-quality of the selected studies (17 of 18 studies were of

observational designs), indirectness (17 of 18 studies included participants located in China or

South Korea, and all the studies had a mean/median between 32-59 years), imprecision (all

studies had small sample sizes with conﬁdence intervals that crossed the indicator for no

effect), and signiﬁcant heterogeneity was present.

Another systematic review with meta-analysis of 1,372 patients diagnosed with multilevel CSM

also determined the incidence of overall complications was signiﬁcantly greater in the ACCF

group compared to those who had ACDF surgery (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.73; p =

37

0.0003).

In this review the minimum follow-up period was 24 months. Limitations involved the

low-quality of all included studies (observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness

(mean ages ranged from 44-58.74 years), and imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes)

A network meta-analysis calculated both direct and indirect comparisons of overall

38

complications for patients who had undergone ACDF, ACCF, CDA, or hybrid surgery.

At a

post-operative mean of 33.3 months, CDA resulted in a lower incidence of complications than

different types of cervical fusion procedures. The limitations of this network meta-analysis

included the low-quality of most study designs (12 of 16 studies were case-control designs),

indirectness (indirect comparisons were a core component of the methodology, and only a

single study included a U.S. population), and imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes).

A systematic review with meta-analysis included 5 NRSI (N=487) that compared outcomes

39

(mean 35.4 months) between ACDF and laminoplasty.

There was no statistically signiﬁcant

difference regarding the complication rate (OR = 1.604; 95% CI, 0.972-2.648; p = 0.065).

Limitations included the low-quality of the selected studies (all included studies were

observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness (all studies had mean ages between

54 and 56.8 years), and imprecision (wide conﬁdence intervals for all pooled data).

Wang, et al. (2022) included data from 5,249 participants (14 NRSI) in a systematic review with

40

meta-analysis.

The number of total complications was signiﬁcantly less for individuals that

received ACDF compared to ACCF (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.48-0.65; p < 0.00001). This study

provided additional details about speciﬁc undesired effects. No signiﬁcant difference between

ACDF and ACCF was found for dysphagia, hoarseness, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) leakage,

infection rate, epidural hematoma, axial pain, hardware breakage, and pseudoarthrosis. ACDF

demonstrated statistically superior outcomes regarding the event rate of C5 palsy, revision surgeries, graft subsidence, and graft dislodgement. The limitations of this review were related

to the low-quality of all the selected studies (retrospective observational cohorts or case-control

designs), and indirectness (11 of the studies were conducted in China or South Korea).

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)

Zhao, et al. (2018) compared ACDF to hybrid surgery, pooling data from 4 NRSI that comprised

44

669 patients.

Post-surgical outcomes were captured between 24 and 38 months. There was a

signiﬁcant difference in total complications favoring ACDF (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.44-0.98; P =

.04). At the discrete outcome level, there was no signiﬁcant difference between ACDF and hybrid surgery seen for graft subsidence, C5 palsy, infection, CSF leakage, dysphagia, or

epidural hematoma. Limitations related to the low-quality of all the selected studies

(retrospective observational cohorts or case-control designs), and indirectness (none of the

studies were performed in the United States, and mean age among studies ranged from 46.1

and 54.36 years), and imprecision (wide conﬁdence intervals, representative of variable

outcomes, were found in the pooled data subgroup analyses for graft subsidence, infection rate,

and CSF leakage).

Primary Studies

One RCT that was not included in any evidence synthesis was identiﬁed. El-Ghandour, et al

(2020) compared ACDF with posterior laminectomy with or without fusion in the management

42

of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).

Sixty-eight patients (mean age 53 years) were

enrolled in the 1:1 randomized trial. No signiﬁcant difference in postoperative complications was found, except postoperative dysphagia was signiﬁcantly higher in the anterior group (p < 0.05).

The authors noted several methodologic limitations including a high risk of bias in the

randomization process, small sample size, and short-term follow-up.

A retrospective cohort compared the short-term outcomes for laminoplasty, laminectomy with

45

fusion, and ACDF. Data from 546 patients resulted in the authors concluding that

laminectomy with fusion carries the highest risk for morbidity, mortality, and unplanned

readmissions in the short-term postoperative period. Laminoplasty and ACDF cases carry

similar short-term complications and risks. Study limitations include the retrospective design,

short-term (30-day) outcomes, and clinical heterogeneity.

Overall, apart from CDA, the complication rate favored ACDF over other types of fusion and

non-fusion surgeries. The certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low due to inherent

study design limitations, indirectness, imprecision involving subgroup analyses, and signiﬁcant heterogeneity.

Cervical Myeloradiculopathy (Mixed)

Cervical myelopathy occurs when there is compression of the spinal cord in the neck area.

Patients present with issues with ﬁne motor skills, pain or stiffness in the neck and loss of

balance. Causes of cervical myelopathy may include Rheumatoid arthritis, cervical spine

46

trauma, spinal infection, spinal tumors or cancer.

Myelopathy and cervical spine instability severity is classiﬁed based on the criteria put forth by

47,48

Ranawat.

Class I – No neurologic deﬁcit

Clinical Outcomes

Four evidence syntheses with publication dates ranging from 2013-2022 that assessed clinical

49-52

outcomes were identiﬁed.

All the syntheses included only randomized controlled trials. The

number of primary studies in the syntheses ranged from 8 to 30, with generally small sample

sizes. The eligibility criteria included participants that were diagnosed with single or multilevel

cervical radiculopathy, myelopathy, or both (myeloradiculopathy). All reviews compared the

effects of ACDF to CDA. Timing to follow-up was variable (29 months to ~8 years).

Núñez, et al. (2022) published a systematic review with meta-analysis that comprised 9 RCTs

49

with sample sizes ranging from 44 to 541.

Clinical outcomes were assessed at a mean of 7.8

years post-surgery. The overall success rate in the CDA group was signiﬁcantly higher than in

2

the ACDF group (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.57–2.49, p < 0.001) with moderate heterogeneity (I =

36%, p = 0.16). There were no signiﬁcant differences between the 2 groups regarding neck pain (SMD = − 0.17, 95% CI: − 0.37–0.04, p = 0.11) with high heterogeneity (I = 74%, p = 0.002). Patient-reported arm pain results signiﬁcantly favored the CDA group (SMD = − 0.16, 95% CI: − 0.29 to − 0.04, p = 0.01) with moderate heterogeneity (I = 31%, p = 0.20). The physical SF-36 (quality of life) component signiﬁcantly favored the CDA group (SMD = 0.13 95% CI: 0.03–0.23, p = 0.01) with very low heterogeneity (I = 1%, p = 0.40). No signiﬁcant differences were found between the 2 groups in the mental SF-36 component (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI: − 0.03–0.41, p = 0.10), with substantial heterogeneity (I = 69%, p = 0.02). Limitations of this review included a

2

2

2

2

high or unclear risk of bias involving all RCTs, indirectness (the mean age across studies was

~44.5 years), some imprecision involving overall treatment success, signiﬁcant heterogeneity

was present in all pooled clinical results.

Peng, et al. (2022) produced a systematic review with meta-analysis of 9,329 participants with

single or multilevel cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy. At multiple follow-up time points,

50

overall success favored CDA (total, OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.11, p=0.000).

Neurological

success results also favored CDA in all follow-up periods (total, OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.04, p

= 0.000). Disability results in all follow-up periods favored CDA (total, OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.49 to

1.94, p = 0.000). Limitations of this analysis included all primary studies were rated as having

unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness (the mean age among the studies

ranged between 40-50 years), and imprecision (all pooled analyses for each follow-up period

had conﬁdence intervals that crossed the null value).

Xing, et al. (2013) included 8 RCTs with sample sizes ranging from 19 to 541. Participants

(N=1,617) had single-level cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy [Xing]. Outcomes were

measured between 24 and 48 months. For overall success, CDA was signiﬁcantly superior to

2

ACDF (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.43 to 2.36; p < 0.00001), with no heterogeneity (I = 0%). The

neurological success rate results showed CDA was signiﬁcantly superior to ACDF (OR = 1.75,

2

95% CI = 1.20 to 2.55; p = 0.004), with no heterogeneity (I = 0%). There was no signiﬁcant

difference between the two treatment groups concerning disability measures. For arm pain,

there was a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups favoring CDA (MD = -4.86, 95% CI =

2

6.42 to -3.30; p < 0.00001) with low heterogeneity (I = 8%). There was a signiﬁcant difference

between the two groups favoring CDA (MD = -7.90, 95% CI = -10.36 to -5.44; p < 0.00001) with

2

no heterogeneity (I = 0%) regarding neck pain outcomes. Limitations of this evidence synthesis

included all primary studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias,

indirectness (the mean age of included studies was 43 years), imprecision (six of eight [75%] of

studies had sample sizes smaller than 400 and all pooled analyses exhibited conﬁdence

intervals that crossed the null value), and inconsistency (moderate heterogeneity in the pooled

results for disability).

Zhang, et al. (2020) included 1,238 participants from 13 RCTs in a systematic review with meta-

52

analysis.

Outcomes were assessed at a mean of 83 months. The overall success rate

signiﬁcantly favored the CDA group compared to the ACDF group (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.29–

2

2.19, p < 0.001) with low heterogeneity (I = 0%, p = 0.62). The CDA group had signiﬁcantly

higher neurological success than the ACDF group (OR = 1.54, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]:

2

1.14– 2.08, p = 0.004) with moderate heterogeneity (I = 34.0%, p = 0.18). For disability results, the CDA group was signiﬁcantly improved versus the ACDF group (MD = − 0.20, 95% CI: − 0.36 to − 0.05, p = 0.009), with moderate heterogeneity (I = 37.8%, p = 0.20); however, the effect size did not reach clinical relevance. Measures of quality-of-life were better in the CDA group;

2

however, neither statistical nor clinical signiﬁcance was achieved. Both neck and arm pain were sig niﬁcantly better in the CDA group than in the ACDF group (MD = − 0.20, 95% CI: − 0.35 to − 0.05, p = 0.01 and MD = − 0.23, 95% CI: − 0.38 to − 0.07, p = 0.004, re spectively), with low heterogeneity (I = 31.6%, p = 0.23 and I = 24.3%, p = 0.27, respectively). Limitations of this evidence synthesis included studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk

2

2

of bias, indirectness (the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), imprecision (conﬁdence

intervals crossed the null effect), and inconsistency (moderate to substantial heterogeneity was

found in the pooled analyses for neurological success and disability outcomes).

In aggregate, CDA demonstrated statistically signiﬁcant improvement across clinical outcomes

apart from quality-of-life measures, which were similar to ACDF. The clinical signiﬁcance of the

results was not described when assessing most pooled results for speciﬁc outcomes. Overall,

the certainty of evidence was judged to be very low. All the included RCTs were rated as having

unclear (some concerns) or a high risk of bias. The mean age among the studies ranged

between 40-50 years and clinical relevance was not usually assessed (indirectness). More than

50% of studies had small sample sizes and wide conﬁdence intervals suggesting variable

effects (imprecision).

Surgical Outcomes

A single evidence synthesis provided data regarding surgical results.

50

Peng, et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of 30 RCTs.

Participants (N=9,329) with single or multilevel cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy randomly

underwent ACDF or CDA. The pooled data showed ACDF had a signiﬁcantly longer operative duration (OR, − 0.28; 95% CI, − 0.37 to − 0.2; p = 0.000). There were no signiﬁcant differences between CDA and ACDF for blood loss and LOS (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, − 2.83 to 4.1; p = 0.72; OR, − 0.01; 95% CI, − 0.08 to 0.05; p = 0.68, respectively). The limitations of this analysis included all primary studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness

(the mean age among the studies ranged between 40-50 years), and imprecision (all pooled

analyses for each follow-up period had conﬁdence intervals that crossed the null value).

Based on limited data, CDA demonstrated more than a 25% reduction in operative time

compared to ACDF. There were no other perioperative outcomes that revealed signiﬁcant

differences between CDA and ACDF. The certainty of the evidence was rated as very low. All

included primary studies had unclear (some concerns) or a high risk of bias. There was

uncertainty about the applicability of the results to the U.S. Medicare population (indirectness).

All pooled analyses for each follow-up period had conﬁdence intervals that crossed the null

value (imprecision).

Radiographic Outcomes

49,51,52

Three evidence syntheses reported on radiographic results in comparing ACDF with CDA.

Núñez, et al. (2022) systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed data from 9 RCTs (N=2,664)

49

who received either ACDF or CDA.

The fusion rate was 94.06% in the ACDF group, with no

data for CDA. The heterotopic ossiﬁcation rate for CDA = 10.3%, with no data for ACDF. The

ROM rate in the CDA group was signiﬁcantly higher (SMD = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.63–2.08, p < 0.001)

2

with no heterogeneity (I = 0%, p = 0.52). Less superior adjacent segment disease (ASD) was

reported in the CDA group (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17–0.65, p = 0.001) with substantial

2

heterogeneity (I = 81%, p < 0.001). Less inferior ASD was reported in the CDA group (OR =

2

0.31, 95% CI: 0.15–0.66, p = 0.002), with substantial heterogeneity (I = 75.1%, p = 0.05).

Limitations of this review included a high or unclear risk of bias involving all RCTs, indirectness

(the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), and inconsistency (signiﬁcant heterogeneity

was present in all pooled results except ROM).

Xing, et al. (2013) measured radiological success as part of a systematic review with meta-

51

analysis.

There was no signiﬁcant difference between the ACDF and CDA groups (OR = 0.87,

95% CI = 0.36 to 2.09; p = 0.76). Limitations of this evidence synthesis included all primary

studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness (the

mean age of included studies was 43 years), and imprecision (six of eight {75%} of studies had

sample sizes smaller than 400 and all pooled analyses exhibited conﬁdence intervals that

crossed the null value).

Zhang, et al. (2020) pooled data from 13 RCTs (N=1,238) in assessing ROM between patients

52

who had ACDF or CDA.

The CDA group had signiﬁcantly larger ROM than the ACDF group

(MD = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.57– 1.94, p < 0.001) with low heterogeneity (I = 0%, p = 0.38).

Limitations of this evidence synthesis included all studies having unclear (some concerns) or

high risk of bias, indirectness (the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), imprecision

(conﬁdence intervals crossed the null effect), and inconsistency (moderate heterogeneity

regarding ASD outcomes).

Overall, apart from overall success, CDA demonstrated statistically greater radiological results

when compared to ACDF. The certainty of the evidence was determined to be very low.

Limitations included high or uncertain risk of bias across all included trials, indirectness,

imprecision, and heterogeneity (ASD outcomes).

Undesirable Effects

Four evidence syntheses reported the pooled results of undesirable effects associated with

cervical spine surgeries. All studies were conducted as systematic reviews with meta-analysis

49-52

of RCTs.

49

Núñez, et al. (2022) described outcomes for 2,664 participants obtained from 9 RCTs.

For

overall complication rate, no signiﬁcant differences were found between CDA (33.1%) and

2

ACDF (38.9%) (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.56–1.27, p = 0.42), with moderate heterogeneity (I = 37%,

p = 0.13). (p = 0.42). Reoperations occurred in 4.4% of CDA patients, a signiﬁcantly lower rate compared with 15.6% of the ACDF group (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19–0.37, p< 0.001), with no

2

heterogeneity (I = 0.0%, p = 0.97). The limitations of this review included a high or unclear risk

of bias involving all RCTs, indirectness (the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), and

inconsistency (signiﬁcant heterogeneity was present in the pooled results).

50

Peng, et al. (2022) included 30 RCTs (N=9,329) in the review comparing ACDF with CDA.

In

assessing implant events, no signiﬁcant difference was found between the CDA and ACDF

groups in short-term, mid-term, and long-term follow-up and total analysis (total, OR 1.14, 95%

CI 0.92 to 1.42, p = 0.23). The incidence of ASD was higher in the ACDF group in long-term

follow-up and total analysis (total, OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94, p = 0.01). The incidence of

dysphagia and dysphonia was higher in ACDF in short-term follow-up. There were no

signiﬁcant differences in total, mid- and long-term follow-up between CDA and ACDF (total, OR

0.9, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09, p = 0.28). The reoperation rate was higher in ACDF in all follow-ups

(total, OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46, p = 0.000). This analysis had limitations including all

primary studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness

(the mean age among the studies ranged between 40-50 years), and imprecision (all pooled

analyses for each follow-up period had conﬁdence intervals that crossed the null value).

Xing, et al (2013) compared the overall complication rates of ACDF and CDA for a mixed

51

(cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy) population.

The meta-analysis found there was no

signiﬁcant difference between the two surgical methods (RR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.48 to 1.23; p =

2

0.27) with moderate heterogeneity (I = 39%). Limitations of this evidence synthesis included all

(the mean age of included studies was 43 years), and imprecision (six of eight {75%} of studies

had sample sizes smaller than 400 and all pooled analyses exhibited conﬁdence intervals that

crossed the null value).

Zhang, et al. (2020) provided a comprehensive meta-analysis of undesired effects for 1,238

52

participants who underwent ACDF or CDA.

The difference in complication rates was not

signiﬁcant between the two groups (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.77–1.32, p = 0.96), with low

2

heterogeneity (I = 8.4%, p = 0.37). For reoperations at the index level, the rate was signiﬁcantly

lower in the CDA group than in the ACDF group (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25–0.69, p = 0.001), with

substantial heterogeneity (I = 61.0%, p = 0.004). For reoperation at an adjacent level, the rate

was signiﬁcantly lower in the CDA group than in the ACDF group (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.26–

2

0.46, p < 0.001), with low heterogeneity (I = 23.4%, p = 0.22). Limitations of this evidence

synthesis included all studies having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness

(the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), imprecision (conﬁdence intervals crossed the

null effect), and inconsistency (substantial heterogeneity regarding the reoperation rate).

In aggregate, ACDF and CDA demonstrate similar overall complication rates; however, CDA

resulted in fewer reoperations and less ASD. ACDF and CDA result in equitable long-term

dysphagia and dysphonia outcomes. The overall certainty of the evidence was determined to be

very low due to the high or unclear risk of bias in the included RCTs, indirectness, imprecise

results, and inconsistency (heterogeneity) affecting multiple outcomes.

North American Spine Society (NASS) appropriateness criteria for cervical fusion surgery as a treatment for cervical myelopathy states “While there are some non-fusion procedures

available to decompress the spinal canal such as laminoplasty and anterior cervical discectomy

without fusion, the workhorses of surgical treatments for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM)

are ACDF, anterior corpectomy and fusion, and posterior laminectomy and fusion. It is well-

accepted that non-operative care is acceptable in patients with mild myelopathy and that

surgery should be considered in most. Anterior cervical decompression and fusion has become

the most common surgical approach and technique for treating patients with CSM. With the

availability of modern posterior cervical screw ﬁxation, posterior cervical laminectomy and

fusion has become an additional workhorse for treatment of CSM, with equivalent results as

anterior surgery.”

Cervical myelopathy: (either from disc herniation, bony stenosis, or ossiﬁcation of posterior

longitudinal ligament [OPLL]) may be considered as an adjunct to decompression when anterior

cervical discectomy, corpectomy or posterior laminectomy is planned for decompression of the

spinal cord.

A multidisciplinary expert panel deﬁned appropriate use criteria (AUC) of cervical fusion for the treatment of degenerative conditions of the cervical spine [Reitman]. Appropriate use criteria

were developed using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology. All scenarios included a

surgical plan as either cervical fusion (nonspeciﬁc) or speciﬁed as anterior cervical fusion (ACF),

posterior cervical fusion (PCF), or combined (APCF). Clinical scenarios involving myelopathy

was most strongly associated with an “Appropriate” rating. A total of 92% of scenarios with

myelopathy, and well controlled medical or mild psychosocial comorbidities, or smokers,

received a ﬁnal rating of “Appropriate.” All (100%) scenarios with myelopathy and poorly

controlled medical or mild psychosocial comorbidities, or smokers, received a ﬁnal rating of

“Appropriate” for cervical fusion surgery.

53

AOSpine North America and the Cervical Spine Research Society published clinical practice guidelines that outline recommendations about how to best manage (1) patients with mild,

moderate, and severe myelopathy and (2) nonmyelopathic patients with evidence of cord

compression with or without clinical symptoms of radiculopathy.

Recommendations based on 5 systematic reviews of the literature concerning the value of

surgery and nonsurgical approaches for CSM were as follows: (1) “We recommend surgical

intervention for patients with moderate and severe DCM.” (2) “We suggest offering surgical

intervention or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation for patients with mild DCM. If initial

nonoperative management is pursued, we recommend operative intervention if there is

neurological dete rioration and suggest operative intervention if the patient fails to improve.” (3)

“We suggest not offering prophylactic surgery for nonmyelopathic patients with evidence of

cervical cord compression without signs or symptoms of radiculopathy. We suggest that these

patients be counseled as to potential risks of progression, educated about relevant signs and

symptoms of myelopathy, and be followed clinically.” (4) “Non-myelopathic patients with cord

compression and clinical evidence of radiculopathy with or without electrophysiological

conﬁrmation are at a higher risk of developing myelopathy and should be counseled about this

risk. We suggest offering either surgical intervention or nonoperative treatment consisting of

close serial follow-up or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation. In the event of

myelopathic development, the patient should be managed according to the recommendations

above.”

The World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) The Spine Committee of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) formulated an evidence-based consensus meeting on the management of CSM to develop recommendations for global applicability.

54

With some adaptations, the WFNS Spine Committee endorsed the guidelines of AOSpine North

53

America and the Cervical Spine Research Society.

Additional recommendations include: using

mJOA or its regional modiﬁcations to classify CSM as severe, moderate or mild and suggest

offering surgical intervention or rehabilitation for patients with mild CSM (modiﬁed Japanese

Orthopedic Association scale [mJOA] score 15–17. They state there is a consistent lack of

evidence regarding the value of nonoperative treatment of cervical myelopathy in the literature

hence nonoperative treatment may not be the ﬁnal decision in most cases. They also share that

predicting factors that indicate a possible deterioration during nonoperative, important

predictors of myelopathy development include the presence of symptomatic radiculopathy,

prolonged motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked po tentials and

electromyography signs of anterior horn cell lesions (low evidence), patients are likely to achieve

a better result after surgery if they have a shorter duration of symptoms (low evidence) and a

call for additional RCTs.

World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) Spine Committee recommendations include:

In patients with CSM, the indications for surgery include persistent or recurrent

radiculopathy nonresponsive to conservative treatment (3 years); progressive neurological

deﬁcit; static neurological deﬁcit with severe radicular pain when associated with

conﬁrmatory imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and clinical-

radiological correlation.

The indications of anterior surgery for patients with CSM include straightened spine or

kyphotic spine with a compression level below.

They clarify in the elderly age groups with bony ankylosis due to osteophytes at C5–6–7, CSM

may manifest at higher levels where motion segments are preserved, especially the C3–4 level

and also at lower levels such as the C7–T1 level. These guidelines provide directives for future

research with suggested outcome measures, variabilities to consider as well as patient and

surgery selection guidance.

55

The Italian Neurosurgical Society (SINch)

analyzed and pro posed their own recommendations

for the management of CSM in accordance with the recommendations published by the spine

committee of the WFNS. The majority of WFNS recommendations were adopted with a few

modiﬁcations.

The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) published 2023 clinical practice guidelines on the The recommendations relevant to this management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy(CSM).

56

evidence analysis are reported here:

For mild cases of CSM, conservative treatment is primarily selected; however, at present

there is insufﬁcient evidence regarding treatment outcomes. Surgery is considered suitable

for progressive myelopathy in which conservative treatment is unsuccessful.

It is possible that conservative treatment can delay the progression of mild-to-moderate

CSM, and therefore, performing conservative treatment is weakly recommended. For severe

and progressive CSM, surgery is likely the ﬁrst choice of treatment. However, there are few

reports regarding the choice of treatment for mild and moderate CSM, and thus, it is difﬁcult

to draw a conclusion.

There is no clear recommendation regarding which surgeries to perform

resulting in radiculopathy or myelopathy. PubMed and Embase were searched for applicable

literature resulting in a total of 33 and 31 articles which included in the systematic review and

the meta-analysis, respectively. Changes in values of preoperative to postoperative patient-

reported outcomes (visual analog scales for arm pain and neck pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI),

JOA score, modiﬁed JOA score, and Nurick pain scale) were evaluated. Patient reported

outcomes, successful fusion, revision surgeries, and complications/adverse events were

considered. A subgroup analysis was performed in two instances; one for studies that included

surgical indications for only myelopathy or radiculopathy (or combination) and another for

studies that included surgical indications for only myelopathy or ossiﬁcations of the posterior

longitudinal ligament (or combination). Cumulative changes in PROMs improved for all surgical

indications including the two subgroup analyses. All surgical indications resulted in pooled

outcomes rates of 98.25% for successful fusion, 1.09% for revision, and 9.02% for

complications/adverse events. Axial pain, C5 palsy, transient neurological worsening, and

wound infection were the most common complications. Limitations include high risk of bias,

reporting bias, confounding, high heterogeneity, included 20/31 retrospective studies, and

combining of different PROMs. Authors report many conﬂicts of interest but none that seem to

impact this study; however, the study was funded by Providence Medical Technology, Inc.

Unstable Spine

Systematic Review/Meta-Analysis Mahmoud and colleagues conducted a systematic review 58 comprised of 627 patients and 36 articles to review the surgical indications, complications, and

functional outcomes of different approaches for hangman fractures. Selected literature

contained at least one of the primary outcomes: functional outcomes, complication rates,

operation time, and blood loss. Minimally invasive surgery, C2 direct pedicle screw, C2- C3

fusion, and ACDF techniques were reviewed. VAS scores fell in all four groups when comparing

pre- and postoperative scores, with the lowest VAS scores observed in the minimally invasive

surgery group. In unstable fracture patterns, the literature showed that ACDF was preferred.

Complications remained low in all groups with the greatest blood loss occurring in the posterior

approach (255.9 mL in open posterior approach, 75.8 mL in MIS, and 64.3 mL in ACDF). Authors

concluded if indicated, posterior approach may be preferred due to lower blood loss and disc

access. When considering posterior approach, MIS may improve outcomes and have fewer

complications. Limitations of the present study are inclusion of studies with retrospective study

design, variations in reporting methods making data points challenging to categorize and lack

comparative outcome studies.

59

Lee and associates performed a meta-analysis comparing biomechanical and clinical

outcomes between anterior-only and combined anterior and posterior fusions to determine

which method of cervical fusion yielded better results for unstable cervical injuries. Ultimately,

the analysis included 12 studies (eight biomechanical and four clinical studies) which included

published dates between 2000-2019. Authors concluded cervical stability can be successfully

restored following subaxial cervical injuries by anterior-only and combined anterior and

posterior methods. No signiﬁcant differences in clinical outcomes were observed while some

advantages were associated with combined fusion in terms of biomechanical stability. Selective

use of methods should be determined based on type of injury. Authors also note need for control

of technical factors of surgery that may have impacted results of cervical fusion. Limitations

include a small sample size, in vitro studies, low number of studies included for analysis, and

risk of bias.

Prospective

60

Yang et al. performed a prospective study to propose a novel classiﬁcation and scoring

system called the posterior ligament-bone injury classiﬁcation and severity score (PLICS) that

offers a quantitative score to guide the need for posterior stabilization in addition to anterior

reconstruction for subaxial cervical fracture dislocations (SCFDs). The study included 456 SCFD patients. High risk patients were deﬁned as having PLICS ≥ 7 together with extremely unstable lateral mass fracture (EULMF). All others were deﬁned as low-risk patients. Anterior only

reconstruction was performed in the low-risk patients and additional posterior lateral mass

ﬁxation and fusion was performed after anterior reconstruction in the high-risk patients. The

visual analogue score (VAS), the NDI, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment

scale were utilized for outcomes. At 12 month follow up, 321 patients in the low-risk group and

49 patients in the high-risk group were still participating. VAS scores from preoperative to 12

months signiﬁcantly improved (from 6.1 + 0.3 to 1.1 + 0.2 in the low-risk group, P < 0.001; from

6.4 + 0.2 to 1.4 + 0.2 in the high-risk group, P < 0.001). In the low-risk group at 12 month follow

up the average NDI score was statistically low 8.8 + 2.5 vs 13.8 + 3.4, P = 0.034). With regards

to the ASIA scale, 80.5% of patients experienced >1 grade improvement. Authors concluded for

SCFD patients, EULMF and a PLICS score of 7 or greater may serve as a threshold for posterior

stabilization in addition to anterior reconstruction. Limitations include the study design, patient

selection methods, and exclusion of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients.

61

Madan et al. conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the functional, neurological, and

radiological outcomes of the patients with traumatic cervical spine instability. A total of 99

patients with subaxial cervical spine injuries were admitted and operated on at a single center

between February 2014 and February 2016 and included prospectively. In all patients, bony

fusion, neurological recovery, NDI and complications were assessed during the mean follow up

period of 27 months (range 12–42 months). Corpectomy procedures that involved 1 level were

77.8% (n=77), 2 levels were 19.2% (n=19) and 3 levels were 3% (n=3). Neck Disability Index

resulted in a mean of 7.57 ± 5.42. Grade 1 fusion was reported in 64.6% of cases. The most

frequent adverse event was dysphagia 79.8% (n=79). Authors concluded an appropriate

treatment option for subaxial cervical spine injuries is anterior cervical corpectomy and

stabilization with cage ﬁlled with bone and cervical reﬂex locking plate. Authors further state

this procedure is associated with favorable fusion rates and is likely a procedure of choice for

posttraumatic multiple disc prolapse. Limitations of this study include study design, single center inclusion, risk of bias and sample size.

A prospective cohort study sponsored by the International Spine Study Group (ISSG) followed

77 patients surgically treated for adult cervical deformities for 1-year.62 Diagnoses included

cervical sagittal imbalance (56%), cervical kyphosis (55%), proximal junctional kyphosis (7%)

and coronal deformity (9%). Posterior fusion was performed in 85% (mean levels = 10), and

anterior fusion was performed in 53% (mean levels = 5). At 1 year after surgery the cohort

reported statistically signiﬁcant improvement in neck pain, ability to perform usual activities and

reduced pain and discomfort measured by standardized scales. Limitations include lack of

control group, short term follow-up, performance at high volume centers with experienced

surgeons that can reduce generalizability, and lack of standardized selection for surgery.

Retrospective

63

Zheng and associates conducted a single center, retrospective, observational study comprised

of 79 patients to investigate the role of ACDF in alleviating symptoms in patients with cervical

vertigo associated with cervical instability. A signiﬁcant relief of vertigo and dizziness was

reported following anterior cervical surgery during the 2 year follow up period.

64

Yang and associates performed a retrospective chart review to investigate the efﬁcacy and

safety of halo vest application before and during surgery in 25 patients with AS and severe

thoracic kyphosis who underwent surgical treatment of cervical fracture-dislocation. Posterior

or combined anterior-posterior surgery was performed on all patients. Authors conclude that

use of the halo vest before and during the surgery is safe and effective while assisting with

positioning, awake nasoendotracheal intubation, nursing, and the procedure by providing

satisfactory reduction and immobilization.

65

Wang et al. performed a retrospective chart review comprised of 36 patients to investigate

the safety and efﬁcacy of the halo-vest in the treatment of cervical fracture in patients with

ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and kyphosis. Authors concluded The AS patient should undergo

early surgical stabilization utilizing a halo-vest to aid in spinal deformity correction and to avoid

neurological decline.

66

Skeppholm and associates conducted a cohort study of 28 patients with artiﬁcial disc

replacement (ADR) or anterior cervical decompression which were recruited from a larger RCT

cohort to evaluate in vivo motion and stability of implanted artiﬁcial discs. Authors concluded

most of the ADRs resulted in favorable mobility and proper attachment years after implantation

with instability detected in only 8% of patients.

Rustagi

and colleagues conducted a retrospective chart review of 29 patients to present a

series of posterior-only operated occiput-cervical ﬁxation (OCF) cases following metastasis to

the upper cervical spine (UCS) and craniocervical junction (CCJ). Authors concluded posterior

OCF without tumor resection and anterior reconstruction can effectively manage symptomatic

metastasis while offering pain relief and improved quality of life.

Luksanapruksa and associates conducted a retrospective cohort study of 33 patients to

evaluate surgical outcomes and complications of cervical spine fractures in ankylosing

spondylitis (CAS) patients who were treated using either the posterior (P) or combined

approach after experiencing neck pain after a fall. Authors conclude, although not statistically

signiﬁcant, posterior surgery was associated with lower blood loss, rate of complications, and

shorter length of stay as compared to the combined approach. Limitations include study design,

small sample size, and moderate lost to follow up rate.

69

Li

et al. conducted a retrospective study comprised of 38 consecutive patients to describe the

authors’ method of anterior discectomy/corpectomy and fusion combined with internal ﬁxation

for the treatment of unstable hangman’s fractures and to evaluate the clinical and radiological

outcomes. Authors conclude study results indicate to address unstable hangman’s fractures, an

anterior discectomy/corpectomy and fusion combined with internal ﬁxation is a favorable

approach.

70

Lee and associates conducted a retrospective review of radiologic images of patients (n=34)

who underwent C1-2 fusion. Patients were divided into one of two groups (the C-arm group or

O-arm group). Authors concluded in cases of unstable C1-2 pathologies posterior ﬁxation can

reduce the operative time by utilizing intraoperative cone-beam CT scans for spinal navigation.

71

Lang and colleagues conducted a cohort study comprised of 33 patients to assess the

radiological and mid-term patient-reported outcome of traumatic subaxial cervical fractures

treated with different plate systems. Authors concluded regarding a fragile fracture, that

dynamic plate provided adequate stability with no signiﬁcant loss of reduction when compared

to the rigid plates. Patient-reported outcome were satisfactory in both groups.

72

Kong and associates retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 46 patients who underwent C2-

3 ACDF combined with internal ﬁxation for unstable hangman’s fractures to investigate the

changes in the sagittal parameters of the cervical spine and the clinical efﬁcacy of C2-3 ACDF

combined with internal ﬁxation. Authors conclude that anterior reconstruction of the anterior

and middle columns with plate internal ﬁxation can successfully achieve stability, correct

displacement and angulation of C2, and restore sagittal balance while maintaining a high rate

of fusion with few complications.

73

Kim and colleagues conducted a retrospective analysis of 65 patients who were treated for a

C1 fracture at single site between 1999 and 2016. Authors concluded type 3 fractures are most

likely to be unstable while type 2 fracture and MVC are associated with higher rates of fusion

failure. Most fractures were managed conservatively.

conservative treatment or other surgical methodologies and evidence is limited to level IV

studies.

75

Jin et al. conducted a retrospective clinical study to assess clinical outcomes and sagittal

balance after unstable hangman fracture in 45 patients. Authors concluded that both anterior

and posterior approaches are effective in treating unstable hangman fractures. They further

state recovery of cervical sagittal balance was achieved by utilizing the posterior approach as

compared to the anterior approach.

76

Garrido and colleagues conducted a retrospective data review of 71 cases to assess the

clinical outcomes of both rigid and nonrigid occipitocervical (OC) fusion constructs of a

multicenter cervical spine study group. Authors conclude a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in

complication rates are associated with rigid occipitocervical construct as compared to

nonrigidly ﬁxed.

77

Dagtekin et al. conducted a single center retrospective study comprised of 88 patients were

included to evaluate OCJ injuries and to discuss the treatment modalities of these traumas and

examine cadaveric studies for a better understanding. Authors concluded while it is essential to

consider fracture pathophysiology and fracture type, they believe the most appropriate modality

for atlantoaxial stabilization is C1-C2 segmental stabilization.

78

Clark et al. conducted a retrospective chart review comprised of 43 consecutive patients to

evaluate 30-day and 1-year mortality rates and review complications associated with posterior

C1–2 fusion in an octogenarian cohort. Authors conclude in the octogenarian population a

greater mortality rate is associated with Initial fracture displacement. Lower mortality rates

resulted with posterior C1-2 fusions with unstable type II odontoid fractures as compared to

nonoperative management mortality rates.

79

Candura et al. performed a retrospective case series on 64 consecutive patients with Type II

Type II fractures can be successfully treated with conservative treatment modalities in elderly

patients.

80

Aldrian et al. conducted a retrospective chart review on 46 patients to evaluate outcomes

following surgical or nonoperative treatment of Hadley type IIA odontoid fractures. Authors

conclude following nonoperative management, Hadley type IIA odontoid fractures are

associated with increased risk for secondary loss of reduction and bony nonunion.

Surgical Approach

Multiple studies have compared surgical approaches and have not demonstrated superiority of

one approach over another. A RCT compared ventral to dorsal surgical approach for CSM and

81

found among 163 subjects the approaches shared similar outcomes at one year.

Other

studies report similar results with some advantages and disadvantages found for each

approach. A meta-analysis reports on 4,348 subjects and concludes that laminectomy and

fusion techniques offer comparable clinical outcomes.

A 2023 systematic review and meta-

analysis also found no signiﬁcant difference in functional outcomes from ACDF vs. posterior

83

discectomy (PD) with moderate evidence per GRADE analysis.

The subject matter experts

summarize that an individualized approach should be tailored to the individual patient’s

pathology to determine the optimal surgical route.

A 2023 systematic review on cervical degenerative disease treatment by the Agency for

84

Healthcare Research and Quality included 57 RCTs, 56 nonrandomized studies and one

systematic review that enrolled patients with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy at one or more

levels and analyzed various surgical approaches used. They report there were few comparative

studies of non-operative treatments, and most studies were rated moderate risk of bias with

most evidence rated lower insufﬁcient strength to draw conclusions on comparative beneﬁts

and harms. They included ACDF, anterior versus posterior approach, standalone cage versus

plate and cage in ACDF, and laminoplasty versus laminotomy with fusion. They conclude there

were few differences in beneﬁts between surgical approaches and techniques for the treatment of cervical degenerative disease however there was some differences in the frequency of

adverse events for some comparison.

The Washington State Dept. of Labor & Industries’ Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee (IIMAC) published a “Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of Cervical Radiculopathy and Myelopathy” Labor & Industries and states: “The ideal surgical approach for radiculopathy related to herniated disc remains a matter of debate. Various studies have compared the different surgery types and found no signiﬁcant difference among them. Cervical surgeries can be divided into 2 major approaches: anterior (with or without fusion) and posterior. Except for hybrid surgeries, the choice of surgical procedure is left to the discretion of the surgeon. Hybrid surgeries combine artiﬁcial disc replacements and anterior cervical discectomy with fusion at select vertebral bodies (adjacent or non-adjacent) in a single procedure. They state there is insufﬁcient evidence in medical literature to permit conclusions on its safety and efﬁcacy.”

85

North American Spine Society (NASS) Evidence-Based Clinical Guidelines on the Diagnosis and

Treatment for Cervical Radiculopathy from Degenerative Disorders agrees that there is a lack of

evidence that one surgical approach is superior. They reviewed multiple surgical approaches

8

and found outcomes comparable with a Grade B Recommendation.

Axial Neck Pain

Background

Axial neck pain is a prevalent condition that causes signiﬁcant morbidity and productivity

86

loss.

Nonspeciﬁc (primary) axial neck pain is distinguished from neck pain associated with

speciﬁc causes (e.g., radiculopathy, myelopathy, stenosis, fracture). The pain distribution is

localized to the neck and immediate surrounding structures and does not involve dysfunction of

the arms, hands, ﬁngers, or other body regions. It is characterized primarily by dull, achy pain in

87

the nuchal region (posterior) neck.

The pain can sometimes travel to the base of the skull,

shoulder, or scapulae. Other symptoms may include neck stiffness, headaches, and localized

areas of muscle pain or paresthesia. Most axial neck pain is diagnosed based on ruling out

speciﬁc causes of neck pain. There is a wide range of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic

treatment options for axial neck pain. The appropriateness of surgery for axial neck pain is

88

uncertain.

The purpose of this analysis is to summarize the evidence on the impact of fusion

surgery procedures for the management of primary axial neck pain.

Literature Analysis

In a systematic review with meta-analysis, van Middelkoop, et al. (2012) identiﬁed 10 RCTs that

compared additional fusion upon anterior decompression surgical techniques. The reviewers

found there was no additional beneﬁt of fusion techniques applied within an anterior

discectomy procedure in patients with neck pain without radiculopathy on pain, recovery, and

return to work. For recovery, the pooled risk difference in the short-term follow-up was -0.06

(95% CI -0.22 to 0.10) and -0.07 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.00) in the long-term follow-up. The pooled

89

risk differences for pain and return to work all demonstrated no differences.

Riew, et al. (2010) conducted a systematic review that examined the clinical outcome in patients

90

undergoing ACDF for axial neck pain without radicular or myelopathic symptoms.

No

comparative studies were identiﬁed; however, three case series were evaluated. All studies

showed a mean improvement of pain of at least 50% approximately 4 years following surgery.

Functional outcomes improved between 32% and 52% from baseline. Most patients reported

satisfaction with surgery, 56% in one study and 79% in another. Complications varied among

studies ranging from 1% to 10% and included pseudoarthrosis (9%), nonunion and revision

(3%), and screw removal (1%). The authors concluded, “There is low evidence suggesting that

patients with axial neck pain without radicular or myelopathic symptoms may receive some

improvement in pain and function following ACDF. However, whether this beneﬁt is greater

than nontreatment or other treatments cannot be determined with the present literature.” The

authors reported several limitations in their review. These included low-quality primary study

designs (noncomparative case series), indirectness (the mean age of patients ranged from 42-

56 years) imprecise data (small sample sizes, and the proportion of patients who achieved a

clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function >30% was not reported), and

inconsistency regarding the selection of fusion levels and integrity of discs adjacent to the

operated levels, and the role of provocative testing)

As part of a Neck Pain Task Force, Carragee, et al. (2008) conducted a best-evidence synthesis

of literature from 1980 through 2006 on surgical interventions for neck pain alone in the

absence of serious pathologic disease. The reviewers found that cervical fusion for neck pain

91

without radiculopathy was not supported by current evidence.

The literature search identiﬁed

4 frequently cited studies, which were deemed to be scientiﬁcally inadmissible, pertaining to

cervical Fusion for non-radicular neck pain with only common degenerative changes.

Palit, et al. (1999) retrospectively reported on the outcomes of 38 patients out of a possible

175 subjects (22%) who underwent ACDF for neck pain and degenerative disc disease

92

(DDD).

No concurrent, historical, or retrospective controls were identiﬁed. Fusion levels

were determined by a painful and concordant response to disc injections. An unknown

number of patients were excluded by the authors or declined surgery. Some potential

patients (again, the number is unknown) were excluded because of psychological risk

factors. The number of subjects lost to follow-up or who refused follow-up was not

reported. There was no apparent standard assessment interval, and the intervals between

the surgery and the reported assessment varied widely, from 2 to 7 years. Other

interventions that the subjects might have received during this period— which could have

affected outcomes—are not reported. Of the reported cases, the mean numerical pain

rating after surgery remained greater than 4 (of 10), and the Oswestry Disability Index

score showed moderate-to-serious impairment in most of the select group of patients

followed. No neck-speciﬁc functional outcomes were assessed. Only 18 patients out of an

unknown number (between 38 and 175) who were operated on by the authors for neck

pain and degenerative disc disease said that the surgery had ‘met their expectations’.

Garvey, et al. (2002) reported on 87 of 112 (78%) retrospectively identiﬁed patients who

underwent ACDF for a diagnosis of ‘mechanical cervical spine pain’ (deﬁned by the authors

93

as patients who had more neck pain than arm pain).

Patients were evaluated 5 to 10

years after surgery. The number of patients evaluated or considered for surgery is

unknown. The selection process and screening were not detailed. Other treatments

received were not reported. The group was heterogeneous for diagnosis: an unknown

proportion of patients had some radiculopathy, radiographic instability, or cervical

deformity. The validity of the outcomes reported is uncertain. For example, it is not clear if

pain and functional impairment measurements were recorded both before and after

surgery; if validated functional assessments for neck pain were used; and whether subjects considered the occurrence of surgery to have been advantageous to their litigation claim

(78%). Only 58 of these 112 patients (52%) reported feeling ‘somewhat better’ or ‘much

better’ than they did before their surgery; only 25 patients (23%) reported feeling at least

‘somewhat satisﬁed’ with their neck condition on follow-up. The authors cited historical

controls treated by nonoperative care of neck pain alone, 21% of whom reported complete

pain relief and 49% who reported partial relief. These cited ‘control’ outcomes were similar

to the authors’ reported surgical outcomes.

Two additional studies are frequently cited to support surgical treatment of neck

94,95

pain.

Both are retrospective case series with poorly reported recruitment procedures

and follow few acceptable study design methods for outcome evaluation. For example, in

these studies surgical outcomes are based solely on surgeons’ perceptions of patient

improvement as opposed to validated outcome instruments. Simmons, et al. report that the

operating surgeon determined that 30 of 31 (97%) patients undergoing ACDF for neck pain

were “all found to have immediate lessening” of symptoms after surgery; they further state

95

that in every case “all pain was gone in a week after surgery”

This observation is unlike

any recorded by validated outcomes measures or collected by independent examiners.

96

Carragee, et al.

go on to state, “It is well documented that neck pain without serious

underlying disease shows wide and spontaneous variations in severity and any accompanying

impairment. Thus, none of these frequently cited, uncontrolled studies can conﬁdently estimate

how much, if any, of the reported improvement was due to a surgical intervention, how much

was due to natural history, and how much might be explained by various nonspeciﬁc and

unidentiﬁed factors. Although these studies are frequently cited as demonstrating clear efﬁcacy

of cervical fusion for primary neck pain, none of these were found to be scientiﬁcally admissible

by the Neck Pain Task Force. Instead, after critical review of the methods and data we found no

clinical evidence, even in the best-known studies purporting deﬁnitive efﬁcacy, to support the

use of either cervical fusion or cervical disc arthroplasty in patients with neck pain without

radiculopathy or serious underlying pathology.”

In addition to the methodological shortcomings of these studies described by Carragee, et al.

(2008), there were further limitations. There was indirectness regarding the Medicare population

(mean ages ranged from 42 to 45 years) and the target condition, nonspeciﬁc axial neck pain,

(the study authored by Simmons, et al. included mostly [64%] of participants with speciﬁc

causes of neck pain i.e., fracture, radiculopathy, myelopathy). All the studies had small sample

sizes (n= 34-84) producing imprecise results.

In addition to these earlier primary studies, a single more recent RCT compared anterior fusion

surgery with multidisciplinary rehabilitation for the treatment of individuals who were refractory

97

to conservative treatment for chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WAD).

This study

included 49 patients (mean ages were 38 and 40 years for the surgery and rehabilitation

groups, respectively) with predominate midline neck pain, who had no neurological

abnormalities and no speciﬁc changes seen on X-ray and MRI. The primary endpoint was the

patient’s perceived change in neck pain assessed on the follow-up, using the disease-speciﬁc

Balanced Inventory for Spinal Disorders (BIS) questionnaire. Follow-up evaluations were

performed at variable time points ranging from 17 to 50 months. Analyses were performed by

intention-to-treat and per-protocol. At follow-up, 67% of the patients in the surgery group and

23% (95% CI 15 to 64) in the rehabilitation group assessed improvements in the ITT analysis.

Corresponding proportions in the per-protocol analysis were 83% and 12%, respectively. This

study was judged to have a high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding or incomplete blinding,

and the outcome measurement (self-reported change in pain perception) was likely to be

inﬂuenced by the lack of blinding. Additionally, there was very serious indirectness (all

participants had neck pain caused by a motor vehicle accident and the mean ages were well

below the Medicare population), and imprecision (small sample size and wide conﬁdence

intervals suggesting variable effects).

Taking into consideration all the relevant studies, the certainty of evidence was judged to be

very low due to study design and execution limitations, indirectness, and imprecision.

Appropriate Use Criteria/Coverage Recommendations

The North American Spine Society (NASS) assessed the appropriateness of cervical fusion for

axial neck pain without stenosis and concluded that the surgical procedure was never

98

considered appropriate.

The authors additionally commented, “There was a trend to be rarely

appropriate for 2 or greater level fusions, whereas there was more uncertainty for 1 level

fusions. Although uncertain, anterior procedures were overall favored over posterior or anterior

and posterior procedures.”

3

In the 2023 NASS Coverage Recommendations ), the committee states “Concerning the scenarios in which cervical fusion is not indicated, recent evidence-based medicine reviews

have concluded that there is little to no evidence that fusion is an effective treatment for axial

3

neck pain without neurological symptoms.”

Evidence-based, clinical practice decision-support guidance explicitly does not recommend

surgical intervention for the management of non-radicular neck pain in adults due to a lack of

99

high-quality data demonstrating beneﬁt and the possible risk of harm.

Analysis of Evidence (Rationale for Determination)

Cervical fusion alone or in combination with other spine surgical procedures is often performed

for the management of multiple spinal conditions. There are three overall categories: cervical

radiculopathy, cervical myelopathy, and unstable spine. There are multiple etiologies which can

be revealed on imaging including herniated disc, spinal stenosis, spinal degeneration, synovial

cyst and symptomatic pseudoarthrosis from non-union of prior fusion. In all cases the history,

physical exam ﬁndings and imaging must correlate with the neurological deﬁcits attributable to

the affected region of the cervical spinal cord and other causes must be excluded.

The natural disease course of cervical radiculopathy is improvement with time and conservative measures so surgical management is reserved for refractory cases or when motor weakness creates signiﬁcant functional limitations necessitating escalation of treatment. While the evidence supporting conservative therapy is low quality there are multiple RCTs and systematic review/meta-analysis as well as societal input and subject matter expert agree on a trial of conservative measures prior to surgical interventions. There is a paucity of data on how long the conservative period should be with reports ranging from 6 weeks to 3 or more months. As the data on disease course ﬁnds most improvement within the ﬁrst 3 months a 12-week trial of conservative management is established, however the policy does acknowledge the need for some patients with progression during this time to shift to surgical management.

Cervical myelopathy (degenerative and mixed) is typically treated surgically due to the higher rate of neurological symptoms and risk of progression. In mild cases resolution with conservative therapy is possible and a trial of conservative treatment is indicated with education on progressive symptoms and intervention if worsening. Guidelines consist of a 6–12- week trial and 12 weeks was selected to allow time for the natural history of resolution or progression to determine if surgical intervention is necessary. In cases where there are progressive symptoms with neurological deﬁcits surgical intervention prior to the 12-week time period can be considered.

In cases of unstable spine surgical intervention is necessary and there are few alternative options to consider. Malignant or benign spinal tumors leading to intractable pain or instability or anticipated instability due to treatment may necessitate stabilization with fusion. In some cases, spinal infection with destruction of bone and cervical kyphosis with cord compression may require surgical intervention to stabilize the spine.

There is not sufﬁcient evidence to support surgical intervention for axial neck pain. Systematic review evaluating outcome for ACDF for axial neck pain with and without radiculopathy or

myelopathy reported low quality evidence and the beneﬁt of the surgery over time could not be established as compared to nonsurgical treatment options. The remaining evidence reviewed concludes very low quality and therefore this is not considered reasonable and necessary. This is consistent with societal guidelines.

Investigation into the optimal surgical procedure has explored outcomes with various approaches. While there are clear beneﬁts and disadvantages of the various approaches the overall outcome is largely equivalent. As there is no evidence to support one surgical approach over another the decision for the optimal surgical approach is determined by the surgeon and patients with consideration of the pathology and evaluation of risk and beneﬁts of the various approaches. This is consistent with societal guidance and expert opinion.
