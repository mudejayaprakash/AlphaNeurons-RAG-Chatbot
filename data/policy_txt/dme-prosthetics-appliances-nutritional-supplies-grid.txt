Item

Coverage Prosthetic

Guidelines/Notes o First, the prescription should reflect the actual number of times that the patient

Catheters and Supplies

Intermittent Urinary Catheters

actually catheterizes him/herself per day. For example, if the patient self-catheterizes four times per day, the prescription should be for approximately 120 catheters per month.

o Although the LCD says that Medicare will cover up to 200 intermittent catheters per month, this is a maximum number and most patients self-catheterize less than 6 times per day. It would be inappropriate to order 200 catheters per month for every patient. The prescription must be individualized for each patient.

o The second important point is that the provider should clearly document in the chart the number of times per day that the patient performs self-catheterization. Just listing that value on the prescription or on a separate form provided by the supplier is not sufficient.

Refer to the Joint DME MAC Letter – Intermittent Urinary Catheterization.

Leg Bags (Leg Drainage Bags)

Definitions

Durable Medical Equipment (DME): Equipment that can withstand repeated use, is primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose, generally is not useful to a person in the absence of an illness or injury, and is appropriate for use in the home. Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, §110.1 – Definition of Durable Medical Equipment.

Implantable Devices: Defined by the FDA as a device that is placed into a surgically or naturally formed cavity of the human body if the device is intended to remain there for a period of 30 days or more. In order to protect public health, the FDA may determine that devices placed in subjects for shorter periods of time are also implants.

According to Medicare, these devices are used as an integral and subordinate part of the procedure performed, are used for one patient only, are single use, come in contact with human tissue, and are surgically implanted or inserted whether or not they remain with the patient when the patient is released from the hospital outpatient department. The following are not considered to be Implantable Devices: sutures, customized surgical kits, or clips, other than radiological site markers, furnished incident to a service or procedure. They are also not materials such as biologicals or synthetics that may be used to replace human skin. FDA – Medical Devices, IDE Definitions and Acronyms and Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 4, §60.3 – Devices Eligible for Transitional Pass-Through Payments.

Member’s Home: For the purposes of rental and purchase of DME, the Member’s Home may be his own dwelling, an apartment, a relative's home, a home for the aged, or some other type of institution. However, an institution may not be considered the Member’s Home if it: Meets at least the basic requirement in the definition of a hospital (i.e., it is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to

inpatients, diagnostic and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, and sick persons, or rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons).

Meets at least the basic requirement in the definition of a skilled nursing facility (i.e., it is primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care and related services to inpatients who require medical or nursing care, or rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons). Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, §110.1 – Definition of Durable Medical Equipment (4) (D).

Orthotic: Devices that are designed to support a weakened body part. (These appliances are manufactured or custom-fitted to an individual member. This definition does not include foot Orthotics or specialized footwear which may be covered for member with diabetic foot disease.) Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 20, §10.1.3 – Prosthetics and Orthotics (Leg, Arm, Back, and Neck Braces, Trusses, and Artificial Legs, Arms, and Eyes) – Coverage Definition.

Prosthetic Device: Articles or equipment, other than dental, that replace all or part of an internal body organ (including contiguous tissue) or replace all or part of the function of a permanently inoperative or malfunctioning internal body organ. In this policy the test of permanence is met if the medical record, including the judgment of the attending physician, indicates that the member’s condition is of long and indefinite duration. Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, §120 – Prosthetic Devices.

of a clinical situation. Physicians and patients should not rely on this information in making health care decisions. Physicians and patients must exercise their independent clinical discretion and judgment in determining care. Treating physicians and healthcare providers are solely responsible for determining what care to provide to their patients. Members should always consult their physician before making any decisions about medical care.

Benefit coverage for health services is determined by the member specific benefit plan document and applicable laws that may require coverage for a specific service. The member specific benefit plan document identifies which services are covered, which are excluded, and which are subject to limitations. In the event of a conflict, the member specific benefit plan document supersedes this policy. For more information on a specific member's benefit coverage, please call the customer service number on the back of the member ID card or refer to the Administrative Guide.

Medicare Advantage Policies are developed as needed, are regularly reviewed, and updated, and are subject to change. They represent a portion of the resources used to support UnitedHealthcare coverage decision making. UnitedHealthcare may modify these Policies at any time by publishing a new version on this website. Medicare source materials used to develop these policies may include, but are not limited to, CMS statutes, regulations, National Coverage Determinations (NCDs), Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs), and manuals. This document is not a replacement for the Medicare source materials that outline Medicare coverage requirements. The information presented in this Policy is believed to be accurate and current as of the date of publication. Where there is a conflict between this document and Medicare source materials, the Medicare source materials apply. Medicare Advantage Policies are the property of UnitedHealthcare. Unauthorized copying, use, and distribution of this information are strictly prohibited.

UnitedHealthcare follows Medicare coverage guidelines found in statutes, regulations, NCDs, and LCDs to determine coverage. The clinical coverage criteria governing certain items or services referenced in this Medical Policy have not been fully established in applicable Medicare guidelines because there is an absence of any applicable Medicare statutes, regulations, NCDs, or LCDs setting forth coverage criteria and/or the applicable NCDs or LCDs include flexibility that explicitly allows for coverage in circumstances beyond the specific indications that are listed in an NCD or LCD. As a result, in these circumstances, UnitedHealthcare applies internal coverage criteria as referenced in this Medical Policy. The internal coverage criteria in this Medical Policy was developed through an evaluation of the current relevant clinical evidence in acceptable clinical literature and/or widely used treatment guidelines. UnitedHealthcare evaluated the evidence to determine whether it was of sufficient quality to support a finding that the items or services discussed in the policy might, under certain circumstances, be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.

Providers are responsible for submission of accurate claims. Medicare Advantage Policies are intended to ensure that coverage decisions are made accurately. UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage Policies use Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), or other coding guidelines. References to CPT® or other sources are for definitional purposes only and do not imply any right to reimbursement or guarantee claims payment.

For members in UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plans where a delegate manages utilization management and prior authorization requirements, the delegate’s requirements need to be followed.
