C. For seat lifts, patient lifts, and multi-positional transfer systems,

see CPB 0459 - Seat Lifts and Patient Lifts

(../400_499/0459.html);

D. Non-powered standing frame system / stander when all of the

following criteria are met:

1. Member has a documented neuromuscular condition (e.g.,

cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, stroke);

and

2. Member has impaired ability to stand, but can maintain

standing position due to suﬃcient residual strength in hips,

legs, and lower body with the aid of a standing frame

device; and

3. Member has completed standing device training showing

compliance, tolerance, and has demonstrated an ability to

safely use the device in the home setting; and

4. Use of the standing device can be reasonably expected to

provide therapeutic beneﬁts and/or enhance ability to

perform activities of daily living (ADL’s) (e.g., functional use

of arms or hands, functional head and trunk control); and

5. Member is unable to accomplish their functional goals with

other assistive devices or the use of physical therapy.

Note: If a member has a gait trainer, they are not a candidate

for a standing frame. This would be duplication of service.

Replacement of non-powered standing frame / standers will be

considered medically necessary when all of the following

criteria are met:

1. Member meets criteria for a non-powered standing frame

system / stander (above); and

2. The device is nonfunctional or not repairable and cannot be

refurbished or adequately repaired; and

3. Device is out of warranty.

Standing frame systems / standers are considered not

medically necessary for members with complete paralysis of

the hips and legs, whereby there is no improvement in the

lower body strength following maintenance of standing

position. For these members, these devices are not considered

to oﬀer clinically signiﬁcant beneﬁts because of insuﬃcient

evidence in the peer-reviewed literature. Further, standers

have no proven value for the prevention or treatment of

contractures.

Standing frame /stander accessories and positioning

components must contribute to the therapeutic function of the

standing frame. Accessories primary for caregiver convenience

are considered not medically necessary.

Powered, electronic, or motorized standing frame systems /

standers are considered not medically necessary. For

information on power standing feature for wheelchairs, see

CPB 0271 - Wheelchairs and Power Operated Vehicles

(Scooters) (../200_299/0271.html)

.

E. Transfer board - for members with medical conditions that

limit their ability to transfer from wheelchair to bed, chair,

toilet, etc.

II. Policy Limitations and Exclusions

Consistent with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services

(CMS) policy, an item/service is correctly coded when it meets all

the coding guidelines and is listed in the Pricing, Data Analysis, and

Coding (PDAC) Product Classiﬁcation List. Claims that do not meet

coding guidelines shall be denied as not medically necessary or

incorrectly coded.

Background

Standing frames (also known as a stander) are assistive devices that

offer an alternative position for individuals limited to supine, prone, or

seated positions. They enable an individual to transition to a standing

position and provide support while standing. Some standers can be

integrated with wheelchairs for seated individuals, while others are

specifically designed to assist those in a prone or supine position to

stand.

Standing frames are generally accepted as a standard of medical practice

when used for individuals with neuromuscular conditions (e.g., cerebral

palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, stroke) who have an impaired

ability to stand independently. Powered, electronic, or motorized standing

frame systems / standers are used primarily for the convenience of the

individual or caregiver and have not been shown to provide additional

clinical benefit. For information on power standing feature for

wheelchairs, see

Standing Frame and Cerebral Palsy

Rapson et al (2022) assessed the feasibility of a randomized controlled

trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of different doses of standing time on hip

migration rate in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Twenty-five children

aged 1-12 years with CP GMFCS levels III-V were recruited and

randomized to either doubling or continuing with their usual time in their

standing frame. Caregivers kept a standing time diary. The primary

outcome measure was Reimers hip migration percentage, measured at

baseline, 12 and 24 months. A blinded assessor measured secondary

clinical outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Feasibility results were

reported following CONSORT guidelines. Of the 25 children recruited, 19

were randomized and 10 completed the 12-month intervention. The mean

daily standing time in the intervention group was 49minutes (SD 39.1)

(Monday-Sunday) and 58.1 (SD 44.1) minutes during weekdays. In

children remaining in the trial, primary and secondary clinical outcome

measures were available in 54% and 90% of children respectively. There

were three serious adverse events, unrelated to standing. The authors

concluded that it may be feasible to conduct an RCT to assess the effect

of duration of standing on hip migration in children with CP with an altered

protocol. The suggested target dose is 60-minutes five times per week

compared to a control group standing for 30-minutes three times per

week, over twelve months. Use of botulinum toxin need not be a criterion

for exclusion and radiography should be included as a research cost.

Standing Frame and Contracture

Gibson and colleagues (2009) conducted a quasi-experimental study to

evaluate whether static weight-bearing in a standing frame affected

hamstring length and ease of activities of daily living (ADLs) in non-

ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP). A convenient sample of 5

children (age range 6-9 years, mean age 7 years 2 months, SD 1 year 4

months) were recruited for the study. Participants stood in a standing

frame for 1 hour, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of

not using a standing frame; each phase was repeated. Popliteal angle

measurements were made at baseline and weekly throughout the study

period. Caregivers provided written feedback regarding ease of ADLs at

the end of each standing and non-standing phase. The authors report

that high compliance with the standing regime was achieved (85% of

intended sessions completed). Repeated-measures analysis of variance

and t-tests showed hamstrings significantly lengthened during standing

phases (mean improvement 18.1 degrees , SD 5.5, P<0.01 for first

standing phase; mean improvement 12.1 degrees , SD 7.7, P=0.03 for

second standing phase). A trend for hamstrings to shorten during non-

standing phases was observed (mean change -14.0 degrees , SD 4.2,

P=0.02 for first non-standing phase; mean change -7.3 degrees , SD 6.5,

P=0.20 for second non-standing phase). Feedback from caregivers

suggested that transfers and ADLs became slightly easier after phases of

standing frame use. The authors concluded that preliminary evidence

shows that 6 weeks of standing frame use leads to significant

improvements in hamstring length in non-ambulant children with CP, and

may increase ease of performance of ADLs was found.

Standing Frame and Multiple Sclerosis

In a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, Freeman et al

(2019) aimed to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a home-

based, self-managed, standing frame program in people with progressive

multiple sclerosis and severe mobility impairment. The study was

undertaken in 8 centers from 2 regions in the United Kingdom. The study

had assessor-blinded outcome assessments with use of clinician-rated

and patient-rated measures at baseline, 20 weeks, and 36 weeks. After

baseline assessment, participants were randomized (1:1) by computer-

generated assignment to either a standing frame program plus usual care

or usual care alone. The intervention consisted of two home-based

physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame

program, supported by 6 follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call).

Participants were asked to stand for 30 min, three times per week over 20

weeks, and encouraged to continue in the longer term, although no

further physiotherapy support was provided. The primary clinical outcome

was motor function measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment

(AMCA) score at week 36, analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat

population (excluding only patients who were deemed ineligible after

randomization, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for

their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide

baseline and week 36 measurements). A 9-point AMCA score change

was considered clinically meaningful a priori. Adverse events were

collected through a daily preformatted patient diary throughout the 36

weeks and analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat population. An

economic assessment established the resources required to provide the

standing frame program, estimated intervention costs, and estimate cost

effectiveness. One-hundred forty participants were randomly assigned to

either the standing frame group (n=71) or the usual care group (n=69). Of

these, 122 completed the primary outcome assessment (61 participants

in both groups) for the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The use of the

standing frame resulted in a significant increase in AMCA score

compared with that for usual care alone, with a fully adjusted between-

group difference in AMCA score at 36 weeks of 4·7 points (95% CI 1·9-

7·5; p=0·0014). For adverse events collected through patient diaries, we

observed a disparity between the two groups in the frequency of short-

term musculoskeletal pain (486 [41%] of 1188 adverse events in the

standing frame group vs 160 [22%] of 736 adverse events in the usual

care group), which was potentially related to the intervention. The

musculoskeletal pain lasted longer than 7 days in five participants (two in

the standing frame group and three in the usual care group). No serious

adverse events related to the study occurred. The standing frame group

had a mean 0·018 (95% CI -0·014 to 0·051) additional quality-adjusted

life-years (QALYs) compared with those of the usual care group, and the

estimated incremental cost-per-QALY was approximately £14 700. The

authors concluded that the standing frame program significantly

increased motor function in people with severe progressive multiple

sclerosis, although not to the degree that was considered a priori as

clinically meaningful. However, the standing frame is one of the first

physiotherapy interventions to be effective in this population. The authors

suggest that the program is feasible as a home-based, self-managed

intervention that could be routinely implemented in clinical practice in the

UK.

Standing Frame and Paralysis

Kunkel and colleagues (1993) evaluate the impact of "standing" in a

frame has on spasticity, contracture, and osteoporosis in paralyzed

males. The authors performed clinical assessment and H-reflex to

evaluate spasticity, lower extremity joint range of motion for contracture,

and dual photon absorptiometry for osteoporosis. The study included 6

paralyzed males (mean age 49 years) who had been confined to

wheelchairs for an average of 19 years. Standing time averaged 144

hours over a mean of 135 days. Clinical Assessment measured reflexes,

tone, and clonus in the legs. Results revealed no important differences

between initial and final scores for clinical assessment and joint range of

motion. In 3 subjects for whom H-reflexes were found, latency and

amplitude were not altered by "standing." Bone density was normal in the

lumbar spine but significantly reduced in the femoral neck. The authors

found that "standing" did not modify the bone density in any site. A follow-

up interview revealed that 67% of subjects continued to "stand" and felt

healthier because of it. The authors concluded that "standing" had no ill

effects, did not alter measured variables, and had a positive

psychological impact.

In a cross-sectional study, Kyriakides et al (2019) aimed to assess the

frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV) parameters at rest and in

response to postural autonomic provocations in individuals with spinal

cord injury (SCI) and investigate the autonomic influences on the heart of

different physical activities. Ten subjects with complete cervical SCI and

14 subjects with complete low thoracic SCI were prospectively recruited

from the community and further divided in sedentary and physically active

groups, the latter defined as regular weekly 4 hour physical activity for the

preceding 3 months. Sixteen healthy individuals matched for sex and age

were recruited to participate in the control group. The Low Frequency

(LF), High Frequency (HF) powers and the LF/HF ratio of HRV were

measured from continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings at rest

and after sitting using a fast Fourier transformation. The authors found a

significant decrease in all HRV parameters in patients with SCI was found

compared to controls. The change in HF, LF and LF/HF following sitting

maneuver was significantly greater in controls as compared with the SCI

group and greater in subjects with paraplegia as compared to subjects

with tetraplegia. Better HRV values and enhanced vagal activity appears

to be related to the type of physical activity in active subjects with

paraplegia. The authors concluded that in this cohort, spectral

parameters of HRV were associated with the level of the injury. Passive

standing was associated with higher HRV values in subjects with

paraplegia. The authors acknowledged limitations to their study (i.e.,

cross-sectional study with small sample size; study used the AIS to define

sensory-motor complete injuries; information on physical activity in the

SCI group was collected as binary parameter, and authors did not record

the vigor and time spent exercising; authors did not assess arterial

stiffness which has been shown to increase in persons with SCI; and they

did not assess blood pressure variability that could provide more

information about baroreflex sensitivity). Future studies should examine

the outcome of different physical activities on the ANS aspects, to enable

designing effective exercise programs to reduce cardiovascular morbidity

and mortality.

Standing Frame and Stroke

Ferrarello and colleagues (2015) state that supported standing is a

common adjunctive therapeutic practice in subjects with several central

nervous diseases who are unable to stand actively. In a randomized

control trial, the authors aimed to verify if the addition of supported

standing practice (SSP), delivered by means of a standing frame in two

durations, to conventional physical therapy (CPT), may improve motor

function, autonomy, and mobility in individuals with disability due to recent

stroke. After baseline assessment, 75 participants with severe disability

due to stroke, all receiving CPT, were randomly assigned to adjunctive 20

or 40 min of SSP, or CPT only (control). Motor function, autonomy, and

mobility were assessed before and after training, and three months later.

All participants assessed received the planned dose of intervention. No

adverse events of SSP were detected. Most outcome measures improved

from baseline through the end of treatment and in the follow-up in all

groups; the extent of change was comparable across the three

randomization groups. The authors concluded that SSP was unable to

provide any sizeable adjunctive benefit, above and beyond CPT, in

persons with recent stroke.

Logan et al (2022) state that there is a paucity of evidence about how to

implement early mobilization for people who have had a severe stroke.

Prolonged standing and task-specific training (sit-to-stand repetitions)

have separately been evaluated in the literature; however, these

functionally linked tasks have not been evaluated in combination for

people with severe sub-acute stroke. Therefore, the authors assessed the

feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a functional

standing frame program compared with usual physiotherapy for people

with severe sub-acute stroke. An assessor-blinded feasibility RCT with

nested qualitative component (interviews and focus group) and process

evaluation was adopted. Participants were 18 years or older with new

diagnosis of severe sub-acute stroke (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4/5)

from four Stroke Rehabilitation Units across South West England.

Participants were randomized to receive either functional standing frame

program (30 min. standing plus sit-to-stand repetitions) plus 15 min of

usual physiotherapy daily (intervention) or usual physiotherapy (45 min)

daily (control). Both programs were protocolized to be undertaken a

minimum of five sessions per week for 3 weeks. Feasibility indicators

included process, resource, management, and safety. Adherence, fidelity,

and acceptability of the trial and intervention were evaluated using data

recorded by therapists, observation of intervention and control sessions,

interviews and one focus group. Patient measures of motor impairment,

activities/participation, and quality of life were carried out by blinded

assessors at baseline, 3, 15, 29, and 55 weeks post-randomization.

Forty-five participants (51-96 years; 42% male, mRS 4 = 80% 5 = 20%)

were randomized (n = 22 to intervention). Twenty-seven (60%)

participants were followed-up at all time points. Twelve participants (27%)

died during the trial; no deaths were related to the trial. Adherence to the

minimum number of sessions was low: none of the participants

completed all 21 sessions, and only 8 participants (18%) across both

groups completed ≥ 15 sessions, over the 3 weeks; 39% intervention;

51% control sessions were completed; mean session duration 39 min

(SD 19) control, 37 min intervention (SD 11). Intervention group: mean

standing time 13 min (SD 9); mean sit-to-stand repetitions/session 5 (SD

4). Interviews were conducted with 10 participants, four relatives and six

physiotherapists. Five physiotherapists attended a focus group. The

authors concluded that the majority of progression criteria for this

feasibility trial were met. However, adherence to the interventions was

unacceptably low. This aspect of the trial design needs to be addressed

prior to moving to a definitive RCT of this standing frame intervention in

people with severe sub-acute stroke. The authors identified solutions to

address these concerns.

Tilt Tables

In medical settings, tilt tables are commonly used as a diagnostic

procedure (tilt table test) to evaluate patients with syncope of unknown

origin. However, tilt tables for home use have been purported in

reconditioning management in persons with orthostatic hypotension, such

as due to spinal cord injury, prolonged immobilization, or advanced age.

https://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/400_499/0481.html

13/19

10/25/25, 12:11 PM

Standing Frames, Tables, and Transfer Boards - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

Patients are reconditioned to standing by gradually increasing the

duration of tilting and the angle of inclination from day to day. There is

significant risk of loss of consciousness if the angle of inclination or the

duration of use is too great. Thus, tilt tables are generally used in a

facility setting and by physical therapists; however, some tables are made

for home use.

Alharbi et al (2024) state that non-pharmacological interventions, such as

tilt training, physical counter pressure maneuvers, and yoga, have been

proposed as potential treatments for vasovagal syncope (VVS); however,

their efficacy in preventing recurrent episodes remains uncertain. Thus,

the authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the

literature using PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases up to

March 2023. Randomized controlled trials comparing non-

pharmacological interventions with control in preventing VVS recurrence

were included. The primary outcome was the recurrence rate of VVS

episodes. A total of 1130 participants from 18 studies were included in the

meta-analysis. The overall mean effect size for non-pharmacological

interventions versus control was 0.245 (95 % CI: 0.128-0.471, p-value

<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that yoga had the largest effect size

(odds ratio 0.068, 95 % CI: 0.018-0.250), while tilt training had the lowest

effect size (odds ratio 0.402, 95 % CI: 0.171-0.946) compared to control.

Physical counter pressure maneuvers demonstrated an odds ratio of

0.294 (95 % CI: 0.165-0.524) compared to control. The authors

concluded that non-pharmacological interventions show promise in

preventing recurrent VVS episodes. Yoga, physical counter pressure

maneuvers, and tilt training can be considered as viable treatment

options; however, further research, including randomized studies

comparing pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, is

needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these interventions for VVS

treatment.

Hoenemann et al (2023) hypothesized that daily artificial gravity training

through short-arm centrifugation could help to maintain orthostatic

tolerance following head-down tilt bedrest, which is an established

terrestrial model for weightlessness. The authors studied 24 healthy

persons (eight women; age 33.3 ± 9.0 years; BMI 24.3 ± 2.1 kg/m2) who

participated in the 60-days head-down tilt bedrest (AGBRESA) study.

They were assigned to 30 min/day continuous or 6 × 5 min intermittent

short-arm centrifugation with 1Gz at the center of mass or a control

group. The authors performed head-up tilt testing with incremental lower-

body negative pressure until presyncope before and after bedrest. They

recorded an electrocardiogram, beat-to-beat finger blood pressure, and

brachial blood pressure and obtained blood samples from an antecubital

venous catheter. Orthostatic tolerance was defined as time to

presyncope. The authors related changes in orthostatic tolerance to

changes in plasma volume determined by carbon dioxide rebreathing.

Compared with baseline measurements, supine and upright heart rate

increased in all three groups following head-down tilt bedrest. Compared

with baseline measurements, time to presyncope decreased by 323 ±

235 s with continuous centrifugation, by 296 ± 508 s with intermittent

centrifugation, and by 801 ± 354 s in the control group (p = 0.0249

between interventions). The change in orthostatic tolerance was not

correlated with changes in plasma volume. The authors acknowledged

important limitations in their study. The authors noted a difference in

orthostatic tolerance at baseline. Furthermore, they did not collect blood

samples at specific timepoints, but rather at baseline and after

presyncope occurrence. They could not exclude that upright

norepinephrine and copeptin measurements were confounded by

differences in sampling time-point given the variability in time to

presyncope. Moreover, given the complexity and costs of head-down tilt

bedrest studies, the number of study participants was relatively small.

The authors concluded that their study suggests that the artificial gravity

protocol applied in their study helped maintain orthostatic tolerance

following head-down tilt bedrest. However, the interventions did not

suffice to fully prevent cardiovascular deconditioning. Possibly, longer

artificial gravity duration or intensity are required.

There is insufficient evidence in the published peer-reviewed literature to

support tilt tables for home use in the reconditioning therapy in persons

with orthostatic hypotension.

Term

Definition

Manual

A wheelchair that has a mechanism that allows user to manually

standing

raise seat to transition from seating to standing position. This

wheelchair

mechanism typically involves using a hand lever or lever system

that engages and locks the wheelchair in the desired standing

position. The user can then use their upper body strength to

maintain stability and balance while standing.

Prone

Lying face downward

Standing

A piece of equipment used to enable individuals with

frame

limited/impaired mobility to maintain an upright position

Supine

Lying on the back, face upward
