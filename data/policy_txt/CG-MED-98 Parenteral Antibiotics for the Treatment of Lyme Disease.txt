Lyme disease

Discussion/General Information

Lyme disease is a multisystem inflammatory disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by the bite of an infected ixodid tick endemic to Northeastern, North Central, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States. The disease is characterized by stages, beginning with localized infection of the skin (erythema migrans), followed by dissemination to many sites. Manifestations of early disseminated disease may include lymphocytic meningitis, facial palsy, painful radiculoneuritis, atrioventricular nodal block, or migratory musculoskeletal pain. Months to years later, the disease may manifest as intermittent oligoarthritis (particularly involving the knee joint), chronic encephalopathy, spinal pain, or distal paresthesias. While most manifestations of Lyme disease can be adequately treated with oral antibiotics, intravenous (IV) antibiotics are indicated in some individuals with neurologic involvement or atrioventricular heart block. However, over-diagnosis and over-treatment of Lyme disease is common due to its nonspecific symptoms, a lack of standardization of serologic tests, and difficulties in interpreting serologic test results. In particular, individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia are commonly misdiagnosed as possibly having Lyme disease and undergo inappropriate IV antibiotic therapy.

Risk factors for contracting Lyme disease are based on exposure to outside environments in areas where Lyme disease occurs. Such activities include working in or near tick-infested woods or overgrown brush. Additionally, people who spend time outside or participate in leisure activities such as hunting, fishing, hiking, or camping may be at higher risk for Lyme disease. Any of these activities bring these participants into areas where ticks may be present.

The following paragraphs describe the various manifestations of Lyme disease that may prompt therapy with IV antibiotics (IDSA, 2006).

Neurologic Manifestations of Lyme Disease (Neuroborreliosis)

Lymphocytic meningitis, characterized by head and neck pain, may occur during the acute disseminated stage of the disease. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is indispensable for the diagnosis of Lyme meningitis. If the individual has Lyme disease, the CSF will show a lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased levels of protein. Intrathecal production of antibodies directed at spirochetal antigens is typically present. A normal CSF analysis is strong evidence against Lyme meningitis. Treatment with a 2- to 4-week course of IV antibiotics, typically ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, is recommended.

Cranial neuritis, most frequently facial nerve (Bell’s) palsy, may present early in the course of disseminated Lyme disease. This can occasionally occur prior to the development of anti-spirochetal antibodies, making it difficult to recognize Lyme disease as the cause. While Bell’s palsy typically resolves spontaneously with or without oral antibiotic treatment , some physicians have recommended a lumbar puncture and a course of IV antibiotics if pleocytosis in the CSF is identified, primarily as a prophylactic measure to prevent further neurologic symptoms.

CG-MED-98 Parenteral Antibiotics for the Treatment of Lyme Disease

A subacute encephalopathy may occur months to years after disease onset, characterized by subtle disturbances in memory, mood, sleep, or cognition accompanied by fatigue. These symptoms may occur in the absence of abnormalities in the electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or CSF. In addition, the symptoms are nonspecific and overlap with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Thus, diagnosis of Lyme encephalopathy may be difficult and may be best diagnosed with a mental status exam or neuropsychological testing. However, treatment with IV antibiotics is generally not indicated unless CSF abnormalities are identified.

Much rarer, but of greater concern, is the development of encephalomyelitis, characterized by spastic paraparesis, ataxias, cognitive impairment, bladder dysfunction, and cranial neuropathy. CSF examination reveals a pleocytosis and an elevation in protein. Selective synthesis of anti-spirochetal antigens can also be identified. A course of IV antibiotics with 3 to 4 weeks of ceftriaxone is suggested when CSF abnormalities are identified.

A variety of peripheral nervous system manifestations of Lyme disease have also been identified. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy include paresthesias or radicular pain with only minimal sensory signs. Individuals typically exhibit electromyographic (EMG) or nerve conduction velocity abnormalities. CSF abnormalities are usually seen only in those individuals with a coexistent encephalopathy.

Cardiac Manifestations of Lyme Disease

Lyme carditis may appear during the early dissemination stage of the disease; symptoms include atrioventricular heart block, tachyarrhythmias, and myopericarditis. Antibiotics are typically given, although no evidence proves that this therapy hastens the resolution of symptoms. Both oral and IV regimens have been advocated. Intravenous regimens are typically used in individuals with a high degree atrioventricular block or a PR interval on the electrocardiogram (EKG) of greater than 0.3 seconds (300 milliseconds). Individuals with milder forms of carditis are treated with oral antibiotics (Lantos, 2021).

Lyme Arthritis

Lyme arthritis is a late manifestation of infection and is characterized by an elevated IgG response to B. burgdorferi and intermittent attacks of oligoarticular arthritis, primarily in the large joints such as the knee. Individuals with Lyme arthritis may be successfully treated with a 30-day course of oral doxycycline or amoxicillin, but care must be taken to exclude simultaneous central nervous system (CNS) involvement, requiring IV antibiotic treatment. In the small subset of individuals who do not respond to oral antibiotics, an additional 30-day course of oral or IV antibiotics may be recommended.

Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Lyme disease. Fibromyalgia is characterized by musculoskeletal complaints, multiple trigger points, difficulty in sleeping, generalized fatigue, headache, or neck pain. The joint pain associated with fibromyalgia is typically diffuse, in contrast to Lyme arthritis which is characterized by marked joint swelling in one or a few joints at a time, with few systemic symptoms. Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by multiple subjective complaints, such as overwhelming fatigue, difficulty in concentration, and diffuse muscle and joint pain. In contrast to Lyme disease, both of the above conditions lack joint inflammation, have normal neurological test results, or have test results suggesting anxiety or depression. Neither fibromyalgia nor chronic fatigue syndrome has been shown to respond to antibiotic therapy.

A diagnosis of Lyme disease requires appropriate epidemiologic data, supporting clinical observations (including exposure to ixodid ticks in an endemic area), and supporting laboratory findings. Over-diagnosis and over-treatment of Lyme disease is common (American College of Rheumatology, 1993; Hu, 1993; Steere, 1993). Intravenous antibiotic therapy in individuals with presumed Lyme disease may be inappropriately recommended in several scenarios, including the following situations: an incorrect diagnosis; prolonged or repeated courses of IV antibiotics; and use of IV antibiotics when oral antibiotics are adequate. Lyme disease may be incorrectly diagnosed for individuals with positive serologies without characteristic signs or symptoms of Lyme disease; or for those with non-specific symptoms, but with no known exposure to ticks in an endemic area; or for those without supporting serologic evidence.

Published literature suggests that use of IV antibiotic therapy should be limited to those individuals with objective and laboratory evidence of neuroborreliosis, those individuals with carditis and some degree of heart block, or in those with well-documented severe Lyme arthritis that does not respond to initial oral antibiotic therapy (Pachner, 1995; Rahn, 1991; Sigal, 1992 and 1995; Steere, 1997). Multiple randomized controlled studies and reviews of long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease have failed to show a sustained positive therapeutic outcome (Dattwyler, 1997; Fallon, 2007; Halperin, 2007a; Kaplan, 2003; Krupp, 2003; Oksi, 2007; Wormser, 2006).

CG-MED-98 Parenteral Antibiotics for the Treatment of Lyme Disease

In contrast to this body of data is a longitudinal cohort study of 158 participants with significant neuropsychiatric symptoms of at least 3 months duration and laboratory-confirmed Lyme disease (Stricker, 2011). Participants in this study were treated with long-term IV ceftriaxone. The dose, frequency, and length of treatment were not standardized, but were left to the discretion of the treating physician. Participants were categorized into five groups based on length of treatment: (1) 1-4 weeks (n=32); (2) 5-8 weeks (n=33); (3) 9-12 weeks (n=28); (4) 13-24 weeks (n=37); and (5) 25-52 weeks (n=28). Symptom outcomes were measured by a questionnaire developed by the investigators that evaluated three major categories including pain, neurologic function, and general symptoms. The study’s primary outcomes were improvement in fatigue, cognition, myalgia, and arthralgia using the measurement tool. Baseline measures indicated significant variation in the degree of symptom severity, but the authors note that this variation reflected real-world presentation of Lyme neuroborreliosis. The results show that arthralgias were significantly improved during the 1-4 week treatment period, (p=0.04) but that no significant improvements were noted in any of the other time periods. Both myalgias and fatigue were significantly improved during the 5-8, 13-14, and 25-52 week periods (p=0.03, p=0.01, and p=0.01, respectively). Cognition was only significantly improved in the 25-52 week timeframe (p=0.02). No data were provided regarding the impact of the different dosing or treatment protocols. These results provide some data to indicate that longer-length treatment may improve various symptom categories. However; the uncontrolled nature of this study, the lack of standard treatment protocols and dosing, the use of an unvalidated outcome tool, and the small sample size of each group do not permit reasonable conclusions about the causal relationship of longer treatment to symptom improvement.

In 2007, a practice parameter published by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) stated that “prolonged courses of antibiotics do not improve the outcome of post-Lyme syndrome, are potentially associated with adverse events, and are therefore not recommended (Level A recommendation).” The AAN maintained this position in the 2021 recommendations noted below.

A biostatistical review published by Delong and colleagues concluded that the results of the four NIH-sponsored randomized controlled trials most frequently cited to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of long-term antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease are significantly flawed, and that the conclusions drawn by their authors are unfounded (2012). Delong, et al., evaluated the methodology and results used by Fallon (2008), Kaplan (2003), Klempner (2001), and Krupp (2003) in a systematic manner. Overall, the Delong review indicates that none of the trials were designed to demonstrate non- inferiority of long-term antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, the studies had methodological flaws such as inadequate power due to small sample sizes, insufficient data on drop-outs, inappropriate combination of data, and use of an end point marker not widely recognized by the clinical community. They assert that conclusions by Fallon, et al., regarding improvement in fatigue measures were biased due to unblinding and were unsubstantiated. Delong concludes that, “the inability of these trials to demonstrate a statistically significant finding provides neither proof of the absence of a clinically meaningful treatment effect nor evidence that patients with persistent symptoms suffer from a post-infectious syndrome.” While many of Delong’s points are technically correct, the authors offer no evidence that repeated or long-term antibiotics actually reduce symptoms experienced by individuals after completion of currently recommended (IDSA) antibiotic therapy of Lyme disease. The evidence of improved net health outcomes from long-term antibiotic therapy for the treatment of Lyme disease remains insufficient. Additional evidence from well-designed, properly conducted and analyzed trials is needed to understand the balance of benefits and harms from long-term antibiotic therapy before such a strategy can be considered medically necessary.

In 2012, Fallon and colleagues published an article reappraising the available clinical trial data addressing what they term “post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.” As with the DeLong article, Fallon discusses a list of methodological flaws in the Klempner report (2001), including accuracy of the Lyme diagnosis, failure to control for pre-treatment disease severity, Klempner’s statistical analyses, and a lack of consideration for the adverse effects of long-term antibiotic therapy. Klempner has disputed these criticisms. A 2014 guideline from the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) recommends use of long-term antibiotics, but its authors acknowledge that this is based on very low-quality evidence. Guidelines from the IDSA, ANA, and ACR do not support use of long-term antibiotics.

In 2019, Berende and others published the results of the Persistent Lyme Empiric Antibiotic Study Europe (PLEASE) trial. This was a randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 239 participants with persistent Lyme disease. All participants received a 2-week open-label regimen of intravenous ceftriaxone before a 12-week blinded oral regimen involving doxycycline, clarithromycin/hydroxychloroquine, or placebo. After 14 weeks, no differences between the treatment arms were reported with regard to performance in cognitive domains (p=0.49-0.82). At follow-up, no additional treatment effect or difference between groups was found at any time point (p=0.35-0.98 and p=0.37-0.93, respectively). The authors concluded, “This study provides Class II evidence that longer-term antibiotics in patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms does not increase cognitive performance compared to shorter-term antibiotics.”

CG-MED-98 Parenteral Antibiotics for the Treatment of Lyme Disease

In 2020, the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF, Rauer, 2020) published their guidelines for diagnosis and treatment in neurology. Their key recommendations* regarding neuroborreliosis were:

A suspected clinical diagnosis of neuroborreliosis (cranial nerve deficits, meningitis/meningoradiculitis, encephalomyelitis) can be confirmed by the detection of inflammatory changes in cerebrospinal fluid linked to Borrelia-specific intrathecal antibody synthesis. Serological testing should only be conducted if there is sufficient clinical suspicion. ↑↑ (consensus 10/13) The following antibiotics should be used to treat early and late Lyme neuroborreliosis: doxycycline, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G. ↑↑ (consensus 9/13) Antibiotic treatment should last 14 days (early Lyme borreliosis) or 14–21 days (late Lyme borreliosis). ↑↑ (strong consensus 13/13) Estimation of treatment success should be based on the clinical symptoms. ↑↑ (strong consensus 12/12)

“↑↑” Indicates a strong recommendation.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published a combined set of clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease (Lantos, 2021). Regarding the use of IV antibiotics for the treatment of Lyme disease, the guidelines state the following:

XIII. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease without parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord? Recommendation

1. In patients with Lyme disease–associated meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or with other

peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations, we recommend using IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral doxycycline over other antimicrobials (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Decisions about the choice of antibiotic among these, including the route of administration, should primarily be made based on individual factors such as side effect profile, ease of administration, ability to tolerate oral medication, and concerns about compliance unrelated to effectiveness. Treatment route may be changed from IV to oral during treatment. The preferred antibiotic duration is 14-21 days.

XVI. Which patients with Lyme carditis require hospitalization?

1. In patients with or at risk for severe cardiac complications of Lyme disease including those with significant PR

prolongation (PR >300 milliseconds), other arrhythmias, or clinical manifestations of myopericarditis, we recommend hospital admission with continuous ECG monitoring (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

XIV. Should patients with Lyme disease-related parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord be treated with oral or IV antibiotics? Recommendation

1. In patients with Lyme disease-associated parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord, we recommend

using IV over oral antibiotics (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

XIX. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of Lyme carditis? Recommendations

1. In outpatients with Lyme carditis, we suggest oral antibiotics over IV antibiotics (weak recommendation, very-low-

quality evidence).

2. In the hospitalized patient with Lyme carditis, we suggest initially using IV ceftriaxone over oral antibiotics until there is evidence of clinical improvement and then switching to oral antibiotics to complete treatment (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

3. For the treatment of Lyme carditis, we suggest 14-21 days of total antibiotic therapy over longer durations of

treatment (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Comment: Oral antibiotic choices for Lyme carditis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin.

XXII. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the initial treatment of Lyme arthritis? Recommendation

10/25/25, 12:05 PM

CG-MED-98 Parenteral Antibiotics for the Treatment of Lyme Disease

1. For patients with Lyme arthritis, we recommend using oral antibiotic therapy for 28 days (strong recommendation,

moderate-quality evidence).

XXIII. What are the approaches to patients in whom Lyme arthritis has not completely resolved? Recommendations

1. In patients with Lyme arthritis with partial response (mild residual joint swelling) after a first course of oral antibiotic, we make no recommendation for a second course of antibiotic vs observation (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Comment: Consideration should be given to exclusion of other causes of joint swelling than Lyme arthritis, medication adherence, duration of arthritis before initial treatment, degree of synovial proliferation vs joint swelling, patient preferences, and cost. A second course of oral antibiotics for up to 1 month may be a reasonable alternative for patients in whom synovial proliferation is modest compared with joint swelling and for those who prefer repeating a course of oral antibiotics before considering IV therapy.

2. In patients with Lyme arthritis with no or minimal response (moderate to severe joint swelling with minimal reduction of the joint effusion) to an initial course of oral antibiotic, we suggest a 2- to 4-week course of IV ceftriaxone over a second course of oral antibiotics (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

XXIV. How should postantibiotic (previously termed antibiotic refractory) Lyme arthritis be treated? Recommendation

1. In patients who have failed 1 course of oral antibiotics and 1 course of IV antibiotics, we suggest a referral to a rheumatologist or other trained specialist for consideration of the use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic agents, intra-articular steroids, or arthroscopic synovectomy (weak recommendation, very-low- quality evidence). Comment: Antibiotic therapy for longer than 8 weeks is not expected to provide additional benefit to patients with persistent arthritis if that treatment has included 1 course of IV therapy.

XXV. Should patients with persistent symptoms following standard treatment of Lyme disease receive additional antibiotics? Recommendation

1. For patients who have persistent or recurring nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, pain, or cognitive impairment following recommended treatment for Lyme disease, but who lack objective evidence of reinfection or treatment failure, we recommend against additional antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Evidence of persistent infection or treatment failure would include objective signs of disease activity, such as arthritis, meningitis, or neuropathy.

The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published information regarding clinical care and treatment of Lyme carditis in 2024 (CDC, 2024). In that document they indicate IV antibiotic therapy for individuals with severe symptomatic heart block, defined as the presence of 1st degree AV block with PR interval ≥300 milliseconds, for a duration of 14-21 days.

Most of the IDSA/AAN/ACR recommendations are supported by very low to moderate quality evidence. This highlights an overall lack of high-quality data to demonstrate the benefits and harms of any treatment approach, including long-term (greater than 1 month) IV antibiotic therapy. In the absence of high-quality empirical evidence, the opinions expressed by the IDSA, AAN and ACR in the 2021 guideline represent the consensus of the expert practicing community responsible for the treatment of individuals with Lyme disease and the generally accepted standards of medical practice.

Date 11/14/2024

Action Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee (MPTAC) review. Initial document development. Moved content of MED.00013 Parenteral Antibiotics for the Treatment of Lyme Disease to new clinical utilization management guideline document with the same title.

Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to adopt a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card.

Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.
