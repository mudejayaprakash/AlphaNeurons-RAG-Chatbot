Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

Aetna considers any of the following colorectal cancer

screening tests medically necessary preventive services for

average-risk members aged 45 years and older when these

tests are recommended by their physician:

1. Colonoscopy (considered medically necessary every 10

years for persons at average risk); or

2. CT Colonography (virtual colonoscopy) (considered

medically necessary every 5 years); or

3. Double contrast barium enema (DCBE) (considered

medically necessary every 5 years for persons at average

risk); or

4. Immunohistochemical or guaiac-based fecal occult blood

testing (FOBT) (considered medically necessary every year

for persons at average risk); or

5. Sigmoidoscopy (considered medically necessary every 5

years for persons at average risk); or

6. Sigmoidoscopy (every 5 years) with annual

immunohistochemical or guaiac-based fecal occult blood

testing (FOBT); or

7. Stool DNA (FIT-DNA, Cologuard, Cologuard Plus) (considered

medically necessary every 1 to 3 years).

Routine colorectal cancer screening for members 85 years of

age or older is considered not medically necessary unless life

expectancy is greater than or equal to 10 years.

Note: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)

guidelines apply to routine screening. The USPSTF guidelines

have no A or B recommendations for high-risk screening. The

USPSTF guidelines explain: “This recommendation applies to

asymptomatic adults 50 years and older who are at average

risk of colorectal cancer and who do not have a family history

of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high

lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (such as Lynch syndrome or

familial adenomatous polyposis), a personal history of

inﬂammatory bowel disease, a previous adenomatous polyp,

or previous colorectal cancer. When screening results in the

diagnosis of colorectal adenomas or cancer, patients are

followed up with a surveillance regimen, and

recommendations for screening no longer apply. The USPSTF

did not review or consider the evidence on the eﬀectiveness of

any particular surveillance regimen after diagnosis and

removal of adenomatous polyps or colorectal cancer."

B. High-Risk Testing

Aetna considers colorectal cancer testing with sigmoidoscopy,

DCBE, or colonoscopy as frequently as every 2 years medically

necessary for members with any of the following risk factors

for colorectal cancer:

1. A ﬁrst-degree relative (sibling, parent, child) who has had

colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps (screening is

considered medically necessary beginning at age 40 years,

or 10 years younger than the earliest diagnosis in their

family, whichever comes ﬁrst); or

2. Family history of familial adenomatous polyposis (screening

is considered medically necessary beginning at puberty); or

3. Family history of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer

(HNPCC) (screening is considered medically necessary

beginning at age 20 years); or

4. Family history of MYH-associated polyposis in siblings

(screening is considered medically necessary beginning at

age 25 years); or

5. Diagnosis of Cowden syndrome (screening is considered

medically necessary beginning at age 35 years).

Aetna considers annual FOBT, alone or in conjunction with

sigmoidoscopy, medically necessary for testing of members

with any of the above risk factors for colorectal cancer.

C. Surveillance

Aetna considers colorectal cancer surveillance with

colonoscopy, ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy or DCBE medically

necessary as frequently as every year for members who meet

any of the following criteria:

https://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/500_599/0516.html

3/103

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

1. Member has inﬂammatory bowel disease (including

ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) (colorectal cancer

surveillance is considered medically necessary as frequently

as every year); or

2. Personal history of adenomatous polyps (surveillance is

considered medically necessary as frequently as every 2

years); or

3. Personal history of colorectal cancer (surveillance is

considered medically necessary as frequently as every

year).

Aetna considers annual FOBT, alone or in conjunction with

sigmoidoscopy, medically necessary for surveillance of

colorectal cancer.

Note: Providers may be required to submit photographs of

mucosal abnormalities seen on colonoscopy.

D. Diagnostic Testing

Aetna considers diagnostic testing with fecal occult blood

testing (FOBT), colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy and/or double

contrast barium enema (DCBE) medically necessary for

evaluation of members with signs or symptoms of colorectal

cancer or other gastrointestinal diseases. For diagnostic

esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)/upper endoscopy, see

CPB 0738 - Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and

Gastrointestinal Biopsy (../700_799/0738.html)

.

E. Biopsy of the Lower Gastro-Intestinal Tract

Aetna considers biopsy of the lower gastro-intestinal tract

medically necessary for the following indications:

1. Microscopic colitis - 8 or more biopsies are considered

medically necessary in persons with symptoms suggestive

of microscopic colitis (e.g., diarrhea and/or functional

abdominal pain) (2 or more from the ascending, transverse,

descending, and sigmoid colon);

4/103

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

2. Inﬂammatory bowel disease, diagnosis - 2 or more biopsies

from 5 diﬀerent locations, including the ileum and rectum;

3. Inﬂammatory bowel disease, screening for dysplasia -

targeted biopsies, plus:

a. Pancolitis - biopsies from the 4 quadrants each 10 cm;

b. Segmental colitis - biopsies from the 4 quadrants each

10 cm limited to involved areas in previous

examinations;

4. Pouchitis - multiple biopsies from the pouch and aﬀerent

loop;

5. Colonic polyps - biopsies of polyps that cannot be removed;

6. Acute graft-versus-host disease:

a. Flexible sigmoidoscopy - 4 or more biopsies from the

rectum/sigmoid and 4 or more biopsies from the left

colon;

b. Ileocolonoscopy - 4 or more biopsies from the terminal

ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending

colon, and rectum/sigmoid colon.

II. Experimental, Investigational, or Unproven

A. Colorectal Cancer Screening

Aetna considers colorectal cancer screening with any of the

following experimental, investigational, or unproven because

the eﬀectiveness of these approaches has not been

established:

Artiﬁcial intelligence-aided colonoscopy (including

computer-aided colonoscopy)

Blood-based protein biomarkers (e.g., BeScreened-CRC,

Beacon Biomedical, Inc.)

Capsule endoscopy

CD3 immuno-staining

Chromoendoscopy or narrow-band imaging optical

colonoscopy

B. Anal Pap Smear

Aetna considers screening for anal cytological abnormalities

(anal Pap smear) or for anal human papilloma virus (HPV)

infection experimental, investigational, or unproven because of

the lack of evidence that such screening improves clinical

outcomes.

C. Drug-Coated Balloon

Aetna considers drug-coated balloon experimental,

investigational, or unproven for the treatment of colonic

strictures because the eﬀectiveness of this approach has not

been established.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a term used to describe cancer that develops

in the colon or rectum. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most

commonly diagnosed cancer among persons in the United States. The 5-

year survival rate of CRC detected in early states is 90 %, but the 5-year

survival rate is only 8 % for those diagnosed after the cancer has

metastasized. Almost 90 % of CRC cases are found in persons age 50

and older.

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

CRC screening refers to the process of looking for cancer in people who

have no symptoms of the disease. Screening tests may identify cancers

at an early and potentially more treatable stage. Testing may also detect

precancerous abnormal growths (eg, polyps) which can be removed

before becoming malignant.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) (Levin et al, 2008) recommends the

following testing options for the early detection of adenomatous polyps

and cancer for asymptomatic adults aged 50 years and older:

Tests that Detect Adenomatous Polyps and Cancer

Colonoscopy every 10 years; or

Computed tomographic (CT) colonography every 5 years; or

Double-contrast barium enema (DCBE) every 5 years; or

Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years;

Tests that Primarily Detect Cancer

Annual fecal immunochemical test with high test sensitivity for

cancer; or

Annual guaiac-based fecal occult blood test with high sensitivity

for cancer; or

Stool DNA test with high sensitivity for cancer, interval uncertain.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, 2016) recommends

screening for colorectal cancer starting at age 50 years and continuing

until age 75 years. The risks and benefits of different screening methods

vary. The USPSTF stated that the decision to screen for colorectal cancer

in adults aged 76 to 85 years should be an individual one, taking into

account the patient’s overall health and prior screening history. Adults in

this age group who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are

more likely to benefit. The USPSTF stated that screening would be most

appropriate among adults who (1) are healthy enough to undergo

treatment if colorectal cancer is detected and (2) do not have

comorbid conditions that would signiﬁcantly limit their life

expectancy.

The USPSTF (2016) found convincing evidence that screening for

colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years reduces colorectal cancer

mortality. The USPSTF found no head-to-head studies demonstrating that

any of the screening strategies it considered are more effective than

others, although the tests have varying levels of evidence supporting their

effectiveness, as well as different strengths and limitations:

Colonoscopy every 10 years

CT colonography every 5 years

Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years

Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years plus fecal

immuohistochemical test (FIT) every year

Guiaic-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) every year

FIT test every year

Stool DNA (FIT-DNA) every one or three years.

A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians on

"Screening for colorectal cancer" (Qaseem et al, 2012) stated that “The

screening interval for average-risk adults older than 50 years is 10 years

for colonoscopy; 5 years for flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast

barium enema (DCBE), and computed tomography colonography (CTC);

annually for guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and

immunochemical-based fecal occult blood test (iFOBT); and uncertain for

stool DNA (sDNA)”.

More frequent screening has been recommended for persons with a first-

degree relative (parent, sibling or child) with a history of CRC. The

increased risk of developing cancer at younger ages may justify

beginning screening before the age of 50 in persons with a positive family

history, especially when affected relatives developed CRC at younger

ages. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (2010)

recommends that people with a first-degree relative with colon cancer or

adenomatous polyps diagnosed at age less than 60 years of age or 2 first

degree relatives diagnosed at any age should be advised to have

screening colonoscopy starting at age 40 years or 10 years younger than

the earliest diagnosis in their family, whichever comes first, and repeated

every 5 years. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy

(2006) has a similar position.

Regular colonoscopic screening is part of the routine diagnosis and

management of individuals at high-risk of developing CRC, including

those with a family history of hereditary syndromes (familial polyposis,

hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)); individuals with long-

standing ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease; or high-risk adenomatous

polyps or colon cancer. Referral to specialists is appropriate. It has been

recommended that persons with a family history of adenomatous

polyposis begin screening at puberty, and persons with a family history of

HNPCC begin screening at 20 to 30 years of age.

Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is a noninvasive test that detects hidden

(occult) blood in the stool. Such blood may come from anywhere along

the digestive tract and for that reason additional types of tests may be

ordered. Blood in the stool may be the only symptom of early cancer.

There are two main types of FOBT tests: guaiac and immunochemical.

Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) differs from guaiac based FOBT in

that there are no dietary or drug restrictions prior to this form of testing.

Colonoscopy will be needed if the test is positive. Randomized controlled

trials (RCTs) have proven that the fecal occult blood test can detect CRC

significantly lowers the rate of death from the disease.

Guaiac FOBTs have been recognized among various CRC screening

methods as having the highest quality supporting evidence.

Immunochemical tests (e.g., Flexsure OBT, InSure FOBT) may be used

as an alternative to standard guaiac-based tests of fecal occult blood, and

have several potential advantages that make them more convenient than

guaiac tests: (i) unlike guaiac tests, a fecal smear is not required for

immunochemical tests -- samples may be obtained from a brush

sample of toilet bowl water; (ii) unlike guaiac tests, immunochemical

tests are not aﬀected by diet or medications, so that dietary and

medicinal restrictions are not necessary prior to testing.

The USPSTF (2016) found that multiple randomized clinical trials (RCTs)

have shown that screening with the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test

(gFOBT) reduces colorectal cancer deaths. Fecal immunochemical tests

(FITs), which identify intact human hemoglobin in stool, have improved

sensitivity compared with gFOBT for detecting colorectal cancer. Among

the FITs that are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

and available for use in the United States, the OC FIT-CHEK family of

FITs (Polymedco)--which include the OC-Light and the OC-Auto--have

the best test performance characteristics (ie, highest sensitivity and

specificity) (USPSTF, 2016).

Flexible sigmoidoscopy enables the physician to look at the inside of the

large intestine from the rectum through the last part of the colon, called

the sigmoid or descending colon. Using this short, flexible fiberoptic tube

that is inserted through the anus, the physician can see abnormal

growths, bleeding, inflammation and ulcers in the lower part of the large

intestine (colon) and the rectum. If polyps or cancer are found, then a

colonoscopy will be necessary to screen for polyps or cancer in the rest

of the colon. Although there are no RCTs proving that sigmoidoscopy

reduces the mortality rate from CRC, a number of case-control studies

have suggested that sigmoidoscopy is effective in reducing CRC

mortality. The literature indicates that sigmoidoscopy can detect 70 to 80

% of CRC. However, sigmoidoscopy is unable to detect the substantial

number of cancers that arise solely in the proximal colon. The literature

indicates that some of the additional neoplasms that it misses can be

detected by combining sigmoidoscopy with fecal occult blood testing.

The USPSTF (2016) identified several RCTs that show that flexible

sigmoidoscopy alone reduces deaths from colorectal cancer. Flexible

sigmoidoscopy combined with FIT has been studied in a single trial and

was found to reduce the colorectal cancer-specific mortality rate more

than flexible sigmoidoscopy alone (citing Holme, et al, 2014). The

USPSTF noted that modeling studies also consistently estimate that

combined testing yields more life-years gained and colorectal cancer

deaths averted compared with flexible sigmoidoscopy alone (citing

Zauber, et al., 2015). Flexible sigmoidoscopy can result in direct harms,

such as colonic perforations and bleeding, although the associated event

rates are much lower than those observed with colonoscopy. Harms can

also occur as a result of follow-up colonoscopy.

Some have advocated whole-bowel screening with colonoscopy

or DCBE because it is able to detect proximal colon lesions. One study

found that approximately 30 % of cancers detected by colonoscopy would

not have been detected by sigmoidoscopy. However, no direct evidence

19/103

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

proves that whole-bowel screening, either by colonoscopy or DCBE,

reduces mortality, although clinical trials are now underway to investigate

this.

Double contrast barium enema (DCBE), also called a lower

gastrointestinal (GI) exam, is an x-ray examination of the large intestine

(colon and rectum). In a DCBE study, the colon is filled with barium,

which helps to see the outline of the colon on an x-ray. The barium is then

removed, leaving only a thin layer on the wall of the colon, which is then

filled with air. This helps to provide a detailed view of the inner surface of

the colon, making it easier to see colon polyps and/or other abnormalities

(eg, inflammation, strictures). If the test is positive, a colonoscopy will be

needed for further evaluation. A study comparing the use of colonoscopy

to DCBE for patients with previously identified polyps found that

colonoscopy detected more polyps than DCBE. Double contrast barium

enema found only 20 % of adenomatous polyps found by colonoscopy.

Colonoscopy allows the physician to examine the lining of the entire large

intestine by using a flexible, fiberoptic instrument (colonoscope) that is

inserted through the anus. This test may reveal inflamed tissue, abnormal

growths, ulcers or early signs of cancer in the colon or rectum. Special

instruments can be passed through the colonoscope to remove polyps if

needed. Although the rate of complications from colonoscopy has been

shown to be low, complications from colonoscopy are more common than

from other screening procedures. Perforation of the colon and

complications from anesthesia have been reported to occur in 0.1 to 0.3

% of colonoscopies performed by gastroenterologists, and death occurs

in 0.01 % of colonoscopies.

The USPSTF (2017) found that completed trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy

provide indirect evidence that colonoscopy -- a similar endoscopic

screening method -- reduces colorectal cancer mortality. A prospective

cohort study also found an association between patients who self-

reported being screened with colonoscopy and a lower colorectal cancer

mortality rate. Colonoscopy has both indirect and direct harms. Harms

may be caused by bowel preparation prior to the procedure (eg,

dehydration and electrolyte imbalances), the sedation used during the

procedure (eg, cardiovascular events), or the procedure itself (eg,

infection, colonic perforations, or bleeding).

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

Genetic testing of stool samples is also a possible way to screen

asymptomatic high-risk individuals for CRC. Colorectal cancer cells are

shed into the stool, providing a potential means for the early detection of

the disease by detecting specific tumor-associated genetic mutations in

stool samples. Fecal/stool DNA testing (sDNA) is performed on stool

samples that are submitted to a laboratory after being collected by

individuals at home. This test detects CRC based on the presence of

specific, cancer associated mutations in DNA extracted from the stool

sample. Individuals with a positive sDNA test result must then undergo a

definitive test for colon cancer, such as a colonoscopy. sDNA testing is

intended as a first line screening test for colon cancer in asymptomatic

individuals. An example of an sDNA test is Cologuard, which may detect

colorectal neoplasia associated with DNA markers and the presence of

occult hemoglobin.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2017) stated that multitargeted

stool DNA testing (FIT-DNA) is an emerging screening strategy that

combines a FIT with testing for altered DNA biomarkers in cells shed into

the stool. The USPSTF found that multitargeted stool DNA testing has

increased single-test sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer compared

with FIT alone. The harms of stool-based testing primarily result from

adverse events associated with follow-up colonoscopy of positive

findings. The specificity of FIT-DNA is lower than that of FIT alone, which

means it has a higher number of false-positive results and higher

likelihood of follow-up colonoscopy and experiencing an associated

adverse event per screening test. The USPSTF found no empirical data

on the appropriate longitudinal follow-up for an abnormal FIT-DNA test

result followed by a negative colonoscopy; there is potential for overly

intensive surveillance due to clinician and patient concerns about the

implications of the genetic component of the test.

Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual

colonoscopy, was developed as a minimally invasive method to examine

the colon. This test has been used in screening and to detect

abnormalities in the colon and rectum (eg, colorectal cancer [CRC] and

polyps). It involves the use of helical computed tomography (CT) and

computer generated images to produce high-resolution two- and three-

dimensional (3D) images of the colon and rectum. Prior to virtual

colonoscopy, standard bowel cleansing preparations are needed to

evacuate any stool and fluid from the colon. During the procedure, a

rectal tube is inserted and the colon is distended using room air or carbon

dioxide and images are then taken by a helical CT scanner. The results

are interpreted by a radiologist. If suspicious lesions are detected, the

individual generally must undergo further testing via conventional

colonoscopy.

The USPSTF (2017) found that evidence for assessing the effectiveness

of computed tomography (CT) colonography is limited to studies of its test

characteristics. The USPSTF stated that computed tomography

colonography can result in unnecessary diagnostic testing or treatment of

incidental extracolonic findings that are of no importance or would never

have threatened the patient’s health or become apparent without

screening (ie, overdiagnosis and overtreatment). The USPSTF stated that

extracolonic findings are common, occurring in about 40% to 70%of

screening examinations. Between 5%and 37% of these findings result in

diagnostic follow-up, and about 3% require definitive treatment. As with

other screening strategies, indirect harms from CT colonography can also

occur from follow-up colonoscopy for positive findings.

The American Cancer Society (Wolf et al, 2018) recommends that adults

aged 45 years and older with an average risk of CRC undergo regular

screening with either a high-sensitivity stool-based test or a structural

(visual) examination, depending on patient preference and test

availability. As a part of the screening process, the ACS recommends

that all positive results on noncolonoscopy screening tests should be

followed up with timely colonoscopy. The recommendation to begin

screening at age 45 years is a qualified recommendation. The

recommendation for regular screening in adults aged 50 years and older

is a strong recommendation. The ACS recommends (qualified

recommendations) that: (1) average-risk adults in good health with a

life expectancy of more than 10 years continue CRC screening

through the age of 75 years; (2) clinicians individualize CRC screening

decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 years based on patient

preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening

history; and (3) clinicians discourage individuals older than 85 years

from continuing CRC screening. The options for CRC screening are:

fecal immunochemical test annually; high-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal

22/103

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

occult blood test annually; multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years;

colonoscopy every 10 years; computed tomography colonography every

5 years; and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.

On the basis of the strength of the evidence and on the judgment of an

overall preponderance of benefit, the recommendation for regular

screening in adults aged 50 years and older has been designated by the

ACS as a “strong” recommendation (Wolf, et al., 2018). The

recommendation to begin screening at age 45 years is based on disease

burden, results from microsimulation modeling, and the reasonable

expectation that screening will perform similarly in adults aged 45 to 49

years as in persons for whom screening is currently recommended.

However, the long-standing recommendation to initiate CRC screening at

age 50 years means that there are limited data on screening outcomes in

adults aged 45 to 49 years. Because of differences in the type and quality

of evidence for screening in adults younger than 50 years, the

recommendation to start screening at age 45 years has been designated

by the ACS as “qualified.”

The American College of Surgeons recommends against colorectal

cancer screening on asymptomatic patients with a life expectancy of less

than 10 years and no family or personal history of colorectal neoplasia

(Choosing Wisely, 2018a). The Society of General Internal Medicine

recommends against cancer screening in adults with life expectancy of

less than 10 years (Choosing Wisely, 2018b). Furthermore, the AMDA,

the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, recommends

against colorectal cancer screening if life expectancy is estimated to be

less than 10 years (Choosing Wisely, 2018c).

An assessment of CT colonography prepared for the Washington State

Health Care Authority (Scherer et al, 2008) found that, in direct

comparison to optical colonoscopy, CT colonography every 10 years is

substantially more expensive and marginally less effective in preventing

cases of cancer (47 versus 52 in a lifetime cohort of 1,000 individuals)

and cancer deaths (24 versus 26). The investigators reported that only

one CT colonography screening strategy is as effective as optical

colonoscopy every 10 years, and that strategy is to perform CT

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

colonography every 5 years with colonoscopy referral for polyps greater

than 6 mm. For this strategy, the cost per life-year gained for CT

colonography versus optical colonoscopy was $630,700.

The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) (Agrawal et al, 2005)

issued recommendations to healthcare providers to begin CRC screening

in African Americans at age 45 rather than 50 years. Colonoscopy is the

preferred method of screening for CRC and data support the

recommendation that African-Americans begin screening at a younger

age because of the high incidence of CRC and a greater prevalence of

proximal or right-sided polyps and cancerous lesions in this population.

In a meta-analysis of surveillance colonoscopy in individuals at risk for

HNPCC, Johnson et al (2006) concluded that the best available evidence

supports surveillance with complete colonoscopy to the cecum every 3

years in patients with HNPCC (B recommendation). There is no evidence

to support or refute more frequent screening. Further research is needed

to examine the potential harms and benefits of more frequent screening.

However, given the potential for rapid progression from adenoma to

carcinoma and missing lesions at colonoscopy, there is consensus that

screening more frequently than every 3 years is required.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) practice

guidelines for "Colorectal cancer screening" (v1.2018) state

that colorectal cancer screening is recommended for average risk

persons ages 50 to 75; however, the decision to screen between ages 76

to 85 years should be individualized and include a discussion on the risks

and benefits based on comorbidity status and estimated life expectancy.

Eligible individuals who have not been previously screened are most

likely to benefit in this age group.

MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is an autosomal recessive

hereditary syndrome that predisposes individuals to colorectal cancer

(CRC). MAP is caused by biallelic germline mutations in the MUTYH

gene which encodes the A/G-specific adenine DNA glycosylase excision

repiar protein (also called hMYH) (NCCN, 2018). MYH is a DNA repair

gene that corrects DNA base pair mismatch errors in the genetic code

before replication. Mutation of the MYH gene may result in colon cancer.

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

In this regard, the MYH gene has been found to be significantly involved

in colon cancer, both in cases where there is a clear family history of the

disease, as well as in cases without any sign of a hereditary cause.

The NCCN practice guidelines on "Genetic/familial high-risk assessment:

Colorectal" (v.1.2018) recommends colonoscopy surveillance of

asymptomatic individuals with known MYH mutations (MUTYH positive

mutation) and colonoscopy screening of siblings of affected patients.

Surveillance and screening is recommended beginning at age 25 to 30

years and at every 2 to 3 year intervals if negative. If polyps are found

(MUTYH-associated polypsosis (MAP)), colonoscopy and polypectomy

are recommended every 1 to 2 years. Those with small adenoma burden

are surveilled with colonoscopy and complete polypectomies of all

polyps. Those with dense polyposis not manageable by polypectomy are

recommended surgery. Per NCCN, there are no specific data available to

determine screening recommendations for an individual with MUTYH

heterozygous mutation and a second-degree relative affected with CRC.

The NCCN practice guidelines on "Genetic/familial high-risk assessment:

Breast and ovarian" (v.2.2019) recommend that persons with Cowden

syndrome should consider colonoscopy, starting at age 35 years, unless

symptomatic or if close relative with colon cancer before age 40 years,

then every 5 to 10 years before the earliest known colon cancer in the

family. Colonoscopy should be done every 5 years or more frequently

if the person is symptomatic or if polyps are found.

No current guidelines of leading medical professional organizations or

Federal public health agencies recommend routine upper endoscopy

screening of asymptomatic persons. Although screening upper

endoscopy has been performed in conjunction with screening

colonoscopy, there is no evidence-based support for this practice.

Currently, no leading medical professional organizations or Federal public

health agencies recommend anal dysplasia screening.

Recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

state (Workowski and Berman, 2006): "Routine testing for anal cytological

abnormalities or anal human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is not

recommended until more data are available on the reliability of screening

methods, the safety of and response to treatment, and programmatic

considerations." The Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee

(OHTAC, 2007) recently systematically reviewed the evidence for anal

dysplasia screening. OHTAC "does not recommend screening of high risk

individuals at this time based on the low specificity for cytological

screening, inadequate evidence of effectiveness for current treatment of

precancerous lesions, high recurrence rates, and no evidence that

cytological screening reduces the risk of developing anal cancer."

Regarding risk factors (smoking and obesity) under consideration for

more intense screening, the 2009 ACG guidelines for CRC screening

(Rex et al, 2009) did not recommend that screening be initiated earlier in

these groups (smokers and obese patients) at this time. The ACG

recommended additional study to characterize the potential benefits,

harms, and cost-effectiveness of earlier screening in these groups.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA sequences that play an

important role in the regulation of gene expression. They have significant

regulatory functions in basic cellular processes (e.g., cell differentiation,

proliferation, and apoptosis). Available evidence suggests that miRNAs

may function as both tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes. The main

mechanism for changes in the function of miRNAs in cancer cells is due

to aberrant gene expression.

Dong and colleagues (2011) noted that recent researches have shed light

on the biological importance of miRNAs in CRC genesis, progression and

response to treatments. The potential utility of miRNAs in the pre-clinical

stage have been explored and investigated. These researchers explored

the literature and reviewed the cutting edge progress in the discovery of

non-invasive plasma and fecal miRNAs for CRC early diagnosis, as well

as their measurability and predictability. They also discussed the utility of

miRNAs as novel prognostic and predictive markers, and their

association with CRC clinical phenotypes including recurrence,

metastasis and therapeutic outcomes. These investigators summarized

miRNA-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms and their potential

influence on sporadic CRC susceptibility and therapeutic response. The

authors concluded that the use of miRNAs as biomarker for CRC is still in

its infancy and need further characterization and evaluation.

Sandhu and Garzon (2011) stated that early studies have established that

miRNAs are widely de-regulated in cancer and play a critical role in

cancer pathogenesis. Recent research efforts are directed now towards

translating these basic discoveries into novel tests or treatments that

could improve the diagnosis and outcome of cancer patients. These

researchers summarized the potential applications of miRNAs for cancer

diagnosis, prognosis, as well as treatment; and discussed current pitfalls

and future directions. The authors noted that there are still hurdles to

overcome such as the development of reliable and reproducible miRNA

expression assays and improvements in oligonucleotide delivery to

specific tissues or cell types.

Ma et al (2012) carried out a comprehensive systematic review of

published studies that compared the miRNA expression profiles between

CRC tissue and paired neighboring non-cancerous colorectal tissue to

determine candidate miRNA biomarkers for CRC. A miRNA ranking

system that takes the number of comparisons in agreement, total study

sizes and direction of differential expression into consideration was

devised and used. One of the most up-regulated miRNAs, miRNA-106a,

was consistently reported to be differentially expressed in 6 studies and

the 5 most down-regulated miRNAs, miR-30a-3p, miR-139, miR-145,

miR-125a and miR-133a, were consistently reported to be differentially

expressed in 4 studies. Moreover, these investigators further validated 5

miRNAs in a clinical setting using quantitative reverse transcription

polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which demonstrated that miR-

106a expression was increased, whereas the expression of miR-30a-3p,

miR-145, miR-125a and miR-133a was decreased in the CRC tissues.

The authorsconcluded that these miRNAs may be the candidates to

develop a panel of biomarkers with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for

the diagnosis of CRC in a clinical setting.

Wang et al (2012) stated that the recently identified class of miRNAs

provided a new insight in cancer research. As members of miRNAs

family, miR-34a, miR-155 and miR-200c abnormalities have been found

in various types of cancer. However, the relationship between these 3

miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-155 and miR-200c) and CRC is unclear. These

researchers applied stem-loop real-time PCR to quantitatively detect miR-

34a, miR-155 and miR-200c expression in 109 pair-matched human CRC

and the corresponding normal mucosa. MiR-34a (2.2-fold), miR-155 (2.3-

fold) and miR-200c (3.1-fold) were all expressed at higher levels in CRC

(p = 0.001, 0.005 and 0.001, respectively). In the rectum, miR-34a and

miR-200c were significantly up-regulated (p = 0.006 and 0.007), while the

miR-155 over-expression was not statistically significant (p = 0.083). In

the colon, the higher expression of 3 miRNAs was seen, however, without

significant difference (p > 0.05). Thee investigators also found that the

miR-34a expression was higher in rectal cancer having more advanced

TNM stage (III + IV, p = 0.03). Then miR-200c expression was positively

correlated with and sera CEA level of rectal cancer patients (p = 0.04).

The authors concluded that these findings suggested that the over-

expression of miR-34a, miR-155 and miR-200c may be associated with

the development of CRC, meanwhile miR-34a may be involved in the

development and progression of rectal cancer. They stated that more

deeply and larger scale research are required to prove the correlation.

Peacock et al (2012) noted that accurate discrimination of miRNA profiles

between tumor and normal mucosa in CRC allows definition of specific

expression patterns of miRNAs, giving good potential as diagnostic and

therapeutic targets. MicroRNAs expressed in CRC are also abundantly

present and stable in stool and plasma samples; their extraction from

these sources is feasible and reproducible. The ease and reliability of

determining miRNA profiles in plasma or stool makes them potential

molecular markers for CRC screening.

Kannan et al (2013) examined the potential use of circulating miRNAs as

biomarkers of CR adenomas. These investigators screened for 380

plasma-miRNAs using microfluidic array technology (Applied

BioSystems) in a screening cohort of 12 healthy controls, 9 patients with

CR adenomas, and 20 patients with CRC. A panel of the most

dysregulated miRNAs (p < 0.05, False Discovery Rate: 5 %) was then

validated in a blinded cohort of 26 healthy controls, 16 patients with large

adenomas, and 45 patients with CRC. A panel of 8 plasma miRNAs

(miR-532-3p, miR-331, miR-195, miR-17, miR-142-3p, miR-15b, miR-

532, and miR-652) distinguished polyps from controls with high accuracy

[area under curve (AUC) = 0.868 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.76 to

0.98)]. In addition, a panel of 3 plasma miRNAs (miR-431, miR-15b, and

miR-139-3p) distinguished stage IV CRC from controls with an [AUC =

0.896 (95 % CI: 0.78 to 1.0)]. Receiver-operating-characteristic curves of

miRNA panels for all CRC versus controls and polyps versus all CRC

showed AUC values of 0.829 (95 % CI: 0.73 to 0.93) and 0.856 (95 % CI:

0.75 to 0.97), respectively. The authors concluded that plasma miRNAs

are reliable, non-invasive, and inexpensive markers for CR adenomas.

They stated that this miRNA panel warrants study in larger cohorts to

confirm and then increase its sensitivity and specificity. Plasma-based

assays could provide better screening compliance compared to fecal

occult blood or endoscopic screening.

Furthermore, a guidance statement from the American College of

Physicians on "Screening for colorectal cancer" (Qaseem et al, 2012)

does not list miRNA as one of the tests for CRC.

In vivo analysis can be described as real time additional imaging that has

been suggested for use as an adjunct to endoscopic procedures. The

methods include, but may not be limited to, chromoendoscopy, confocal

microscopy, fiberoptic analysis and narrow band imaging. These

techniques are utilized during the endoscopic procedures and purportedly

improve analysis of the lesions in the colon. An example of a confocal

microscopy device is the Cellvizio system.

Chung et al (2014) stated that virtual chromoendoscopy (CE) is expected

to enhance adenoma yield and reduce variation in performance between

colonoscopists. These researchers compared the efficacy of narrow-

band imaging (NBI), flexible spectral imaging CE (FICE) and white light

(WL) colonoscopy and their impact for less experienced endoscopists.

They performed a randomized tandem colonoscopy trial controlling for

withdrawal time and bowel preparation. Average-risk adults undergoing

screening colonoscopy were enrolled and randomly assigned to first

withdrawal with one of the three imaging modalities (NBI (NBI-WL group),

FICE (FICE-WL group) and WL (WL-WL group)). Eight colonoscopists

were categorized into expert and non-expert subgroups. A total of 1,650

subjects (mean age of 51.4 years, 63.9 % men) were included (550 in

each group). Compared with WL, neither NBI nor FICE increased the

mean number of adenomas detected per patient (0.37 versus 0.35 and

0.36; p = 0.591) or the percentage of patients with adenoma (25.3 %

versus 24.5 % and 23.6 %; p = 0.753). For all 3 modalities, expert

subgroups had higher yields of adenomas than non-expert subgroups.

Learning curves were observed only for non-expert subgroups with all 3

modalities. The percentage of missed adenomas did not differ between

the 3 groups (20.8 % by WL versus 22.9 % by NBI and 26.0 % by FICE, p

= 0.300) and was not affected by endoscopists' expertise. The authors

concluded that neither NBI nor FICE improved adenoma detection or

miss rates, with no difference in diagnostic efficacy between the 2

systems; virtual CE had no additional benefits over WL for non-experts.

Jang et al (2014) noted that distinguishing deep submucosa (SM) from

superficial SM cancer in large sessile and flat colorectal polyps (greater

than 2 cm) is crucial in making the most appropriate therapeutic decision.

These researchers evaluated the additional role of magnifying NBI and

magnifying CE (MCE) in assessing the depth of invasion in large sessile

and flat polyps in comparison to morphological evaluation performed by

experienced endoscopists. From May 2011 to December 2011, a total of

85 large sessile and flat polyps were analyzed. Endoscopic features of

the polyps were independently evaluated by experienced endoscopists.

Subsequently, the polyps were observed using magnifying NBI and

MCE. A total of 58 intra-mucosal lesions and 27 SM cancers (5

superficial and 22 deep) were identified. The diagnostic accuracy of the

experienced endoscopists, NBI, and MCE were 92.9, 90.6, and 89.4 %,

respectively, for deep SM cancer. In combination with NBI or MCE, the

diagnostic accuracy of the experienced endoscopists did not change

significantly for deep SM cancer, with an accuracy of 95.3 % for both NBI

and MCE. The authors concluded that conventional colonoscopy can

differentiate superficial from deep SM cancers with an accuracy of as

high as 92.9 % in large sessile and flat polyps.

In a meta-analysis, Xing and colleagues (2014) identified the value of

serum matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) levels for the diagnosis of

CRC. Through searching the following electronic databases: Cochrane

Library (Issue 12, 2014), Web of Science (1945 to 2014), PubMed (1966

to 2014), CINAHL (1982 to 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014), and CBM

(1982 to 2014), related articles were determined without any language

restrictions. Stata statistical software (Version 12.0, Stata Corporation,

College Station, TX) was chosen to deal with statistical data. Standard

mean difference (SMD) and its corresponding 95 % CI were calculated to

clarify the correlation between serum MMP-7 levels and CRC. A total of 7

clinical case-control studies that recruited 430 CRC patients and 357

healthy subjects were selected for statistical analysis. The main findings

of the meta-analysis showed that the serum MMP-7 level in CRC patients

was significantly higher than that in control subjects (SMD = 2.15, 95 %

CI: 1.46 to 2.84, p < 0.001). Ethnicity-stratified analysis indicated a higher

serum MMP-7 level in CRC patients than that of control subjects among

the Asians and the Caucasians (Asians: SMD = 2.83, 95 % CI: 1.76 -

3.91, p < 0.001; Caucasians: SMD = 1.06, 95 % CI: 0.46 to 1.66, p =

0.001; respectively). The authors concluded that the present meta-

analysis indicated that the increased serum level of MMP-7 may be

connected with the development of CRC; thus, serum levels of MMP-7

could be an independent biomarker for CRC patients.

Shah et al (2014) stated that there is growing interest in early detection of

CRC as current screening modalities lack compliance and specificity.

These researchers reviewed the literature to identify biomarkers for early

detection of CRC and polyps. Literature searches were conducted for

relevant papers since 2007. Human studies reporting on early detection

of CRC and polyps using biomarkers were included. Methodologic

quality was evaluated, and sensitivity, specificity, and the positive

predictive value (PPV) were reported. The search strategy identified

3,348 abstracts. A total of 44 papers, examining 67 different tumor

markers, were included. Overall sensitivities for CRC detection by fecal

DNA markers ranged from 53 % to 87 %. Combining fecal DNA markers

increased the sensitivity of CRC and adenoma detection. Canine scent

detection had a sensitivity of detecting CRC of 99 % and specificity of 97

%. The PPV of iFOBT was 1.26 %, compared with 0.31 % for the current

screening method of gFOBT. A panel of serum protein biomarkers

provided a sensitivity and specificity above 85 % for all stages of CRC,

and a PPV of 0.72 %. Combinations of fecal and serum biomarkers

produced higher sensitivities, specificities, and PPVs for early detection of

CRC and adenomas. The authors concluded that further research is

needed to validate these biomarkers in a well-structured population-

based study.

An UpToDate review on “Tests for screening for colorectal cancer: Stool

tests, radiologic imaging and endoscopy” (Fletcher, 2015) states that

“Serum markers -- Current serum markers are not sufficiently sensitive or

specific to be used for screening. The potential to utilize a combination of

six serum markers to improve the test has been reported in a feasibility

study, but validation studies in screening populations are needed before

clinical relevance can be determined.

One blood test that detects Septin 9 hypermethylation in DNA from

™

plasma (ColoVantage ) has been approved in 2011 by the New York

State Health Department for colon cancer. In one study of an assay for

Septin 9 (SEPT9), the sensitivities for adenomas (1 to 5 cm), for stage I

to III CRC, and for stage IV CRC were 14, 50, and 88 %, respectively.

The false-positive rate was 27 %. These test characteristics suggest that

a serum Septin 9 assay is not sufficiently sensitive for identifying cancer

or cancer precursors at a treatable stage, but would lead to many false-

positive findings.

Blood-based biomarker panels are tests to assess the expression of

genes to purportedly calculate a relative risk of having CRC. An example

of this type of test is ColonSentry, which is supposedly believed to

increase individual compliance with colonoscopy. The seven genes that

are measured in this test include:

ANXA3, CLEC4D, IL2RB, LMNB1, PRRG4. TNFAIP6, and VNN139.

The New York State Department of Health also approved a 7-gene test

(ColonSentry) in February 2012 to be used to identify patients at

increased risk of colorectal cancer in order to target such patients for

monitoring to assure compliance with regular colonoscopy. However, it

has not been shown that the test can detect early-stage cancers, for

which screening would be most effective, and test sensitivity (61 to 82 %)

and specificity (64 to 77 %) were only fair for CRC at any stage when

tested in populations that included a substantial proportion of patients

with known CRC.

In a study that compared the performance of serum markers (C-reactive

protein, serum CD26 [sCD26], complement C3a anaphylatoxin, and

tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases [TIMP-1]) with stool fecal occult

blood tests for the detection of colon cancer and advanced adenomas

among patients with known and no known colon disease, at a specificity

of 97.7 %, the sensitivity of the 4 serum markers was less than 20 %

compared with 40 % for gFOBT and 66 % for iFOBT.

Thus, until further evidence is available, we do not recommend serum

tests for colorectal cancer screening”.

The UpToDate review (Fletcher, 2015) also states that “Several other

technologies have been used in various clinical settings, but their value in

screening for colorectal cancer has yet to be established.

Chromoendoscopy involves the application of stains or pigment to

improve the identiﬁcation of abnormal mucosal tissue.

Magniﬁcation endoscopy, with or without staining, allows the

endoscopist to better visualize mucosal details with 80- to 100-fold

image enhancement.

Narrow band imaging optical colonoscopy modiﬁes the bandwidth

and wavelength of the light used in colonoscopy, allowing better

visualization of vascular changes in superﬁcial lesions”.

Retrograde imaging/illumination (e.g., Third Eye Retroscope, Third Eye

Panoramic Auxiliary Endoscopy System) are imaging devices that have

been suggested to provide illumination and continuous retrograde views

of the colon. Examples of these devices include, but may not be limited

to, are the Third Eye Retroscope, which involves the use of a J-shaped

catheter that contains an imaging device that can be inserted into

endoscopic working channel. It is intended for single use and is

disposable. Another example of these devices is the Third Eye Panoramic

device, which can be attached to the distal end of the colonoscope with a

flexible clip and provides continuous left-side and right-side views of the

colon and are displayed simultaneously on three monitors.

Anal Pap Smear

In a prospective, cohort study, Schofield and colleagues (2016) sought to

establish the feasibility and acceptability of anal screening among men

who have sex with men (MSM). Subjects were known HIV-positive and

negative MSM who have anoreceptive intercourse. Intervention was anal

screening with HPV testing, liquid-based cytology and high-resolution

anoscopy (HRA) with biopsy of anoscopic abnormalities. Participants

completed questionnaires at baseline and at 6 months. Anal HPV was

highly prevalent in MSM (HIV-positive, 88 %; and HIV-negative, 78 %).

Despite the high prevalence of cytological abnormality in both HIV-

positive (46.2 %) and HIV-negative (35.0 %) MSM, almost 50 % of anal

intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) of all grades were associated with negative

cytology. Anoscopically directed biopsies detected AIN3 or worse

https://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/500_599/0516.html

33/103

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

(AIN3+) in 14 of 203 (6.9 %) of HIV-positive MSM and 3 of 81 (3.7 %)

HIV-negative MSM. The corresponding prevalence of AIN2+ was 26.6 %

and 20.9 %, respectively; 1 case of AIN3 was detected at the 2nd visit.

Screening was considered to be highly acceptable by participants. The

authors concluded that high prevalence of high-risk-HPV and frequency

of false negative cytology in this study suggested that HRA would have

most clinical utility, as a primary screening tool for anal cancer in a high-

risk group. The prevalence of AIN3+ in HIV-positive MSM provided

support for a policy of screening this group, but the high prevalence of

lower grade lesions that do not warrant immediate treatment and the

limitations of treating high-grade lesions requires careful consideration in

terms of a screening policy.

In a review on “Anal cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia screening”,

Leeds and Fang (2016) focused on the early diagnosis of anal cancer

and its precursor lesions through routine screening. A number of risk-

stratification strategies as well as screening techniques have been

suggested, and currently little consensus exists among national societies.

Much of the current clinical rationale for the prevention of anal cancer

derives from the similar tumor biology of cervical cancer and the

successful use of routine screening to identify cervical cancer and its

precursors early in the disease process. It is thought that such a strategy

of identifying early anal intraepithelial neoplasia will reduce the incidence

of invasive anal cancer. The low prevalence of anal cancer in the general

population prevents the use of routine screening. However, routine

screening of selected populations has been shown to be a more

promising strategy. Potential screening modalities include digital

anorectal exam, anal Papanicolaou testing, HPV co-testing, and HRA.

The authors concluded that additional research associating high-grade

dysplasia treatment with anal cancer prevention as well as direct

comparisons of screening regimens is needed to develop further anal

cancer screening recommendations.

An UpToDate review on “Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions:

Diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment” (Palefsky and Cranston,

2017) stated that “Formal guidelines recommending anal screening for

precancerous lesions have not been adopted by the United States Public

Health Service. For HIV-infected patients, the HIV Medical Association of

the Infectious Diseases Society of America makes a weak

recommendation based on moderate quality evidence for screening with

anal cytology in MSM, women with a history of receptive anal intercourse

or abnormal cervical Pap test results, and those with genital warts”.

Analysis of Fecal Volatile Organic Compounds for Colorectal Cancer

Screening

Bosch and colleagues (2019) noted that the fecal volatolome, which is

composed of fecal volatile organic compounds (VOCs), appeared to hold

potential as non-invasive biomarker for the detection of CRC and its

precursor lesions advanced adenomas (AA). The potential of the fecal

volatolome has been subject of various studies using either chemical

analytical or pattern-recognition techniques. These investigators

reviewed available literature on the potential of the fecal volatolome as

CRC and AA biomarker. They performed a systematic literature search in

PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and

ResearchGate using the following keywords: Colorectal cancer, advanced

adenoma, volatile organic compound, metabolome, gas

chromatrography-mass spectrometry, selected-ion flow-tube mass

spectrometry, eNose, and fecal biomarkers. A total of 88 titles or

abstracts were identified from the search, of which 11 papers describing

the potential of the fecal volatolome for CRC detection were selected. In

these studies, different techniques were used for the headspace analyses

of fecal VOCs, limiting the possibility to compare outcomes. Increased

levels of amino acids and short chain fatty acids, and decreased levels of

bile acids and polyol alcohols in the gas phase of feces were observed

repeatedly. All selected papers reported high diagnostic value for the

detection of both CRC and AA based on fecal VOCs. The authors

concluded that based on the included studies, fecal VOC analyses

appeared promising for future screening of CRC and AA, with potentially

improved test performances allowing for earlier detection of AA and CRC;

and consequently earlier initiation of treatment, possibly reducing

morbidity and mortality rates next to lower rates of (unnecessary)

colonoscopies.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, van Liere et al (2023)

examined the diagnostic potential of urinary VOCs for CRC/adenomas.

By relating VOCs to known pathways, these researchers aimed to gain

insight into the pathophysiology of colorectal neoplasia. They carried out

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

a systematic search in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Original

studies on urinary VOCs for CRC/adenoma detection with a control group

were included. QUADAS-2 tool was used for quality assessment. Meta-

analysis was carried out by adopting a bi-variate model for

sensitivity/specificity. Fagan's nomogram estimated the performance of

combined FIT-VOC. Neoplasm-associated VOCs were linked to

pathways using the KEGG database. A total of 16 studies entailing 837

CRC patients and 1,618 controls were included; 11 performed chemical

identification and 7 chemical fingerprinting. In all studies, urinary VOCs

discriminated CRC from controls. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for

CRC based on chemical fingerprinting were 84 % (95 % CI: 73 % to 91

%) and 70 % (95 % CI: 63 % to 77 %), respectively. The most distinctive

individual VOC was butanal (AUC 0.98). The estimated probability of

having CRC following negative FIT was 0.38 %, whereas 0.09 %

following negative FIT-VOC. Combined FIT-VOC would detect 33 %

more CRCs. In total, 100 CRC-associated urinary VOCs were identified;

particularly hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, aldehydes/ketones and amino

acids, and predominantly involved in TCA-cycle or alanine / aspartate /

glutamine / glutamate / phenylalanine / tyrosine / tryptophan metabolism,

which was supported by previous research on (colorectal) cancer

biology. The potential of urinary VOCs to detect pre-cancerous

adenomas or gain insight into their pathophysiology appeared under-

studied. The authors concluded that urinary VOCs hold potential for non-

invasive CRC screening. These researchers stated that multi-center

validation studies are needed, especially focusing on adenoma detection.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence-Aided Colonoscopy for Screening of Colorectal

Cancer

Brown et al (2022) noted that artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-

aided polyp detection (CADe) systems are intended to address the issue

of missed polyps during colonoscopy. The effect of CADe during

screening and surveillance colonoscopy has not previously been studied

in a U.S. population. In a prospective, single-blind, multi-center,

randomized tandem colonoscopy study, these researchers examined the

effectiveness of a deep-learning (DL)-based CADe system

(EndoScreener, Shanghai Wision AI, China). Participants were enrolled

across 4 U.S. academic medical centers from 2019 through 2020.

Patients presenting for CRC screening or surveillance were randomized

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

to CADe colonoscopy first or high-definition white light (HDWL)

colonoscopy first, followed immediately by the other procedure in tandem

fashion by the same endoscopist. The primary outcome was adenoma

miss rate (AMR), and secondary outcomes included sessile serrated

lesion (SSL) miss rate and adenomas per colonoscopy (APC). A total of

232 patients entered the study, with 116 patients randomized to undergo

CADe colonoscopy first and 116 patients randomized to undergo HDWL

colonoscopy first. After the exclusion of 9 patients, the study cohort

included 223 patients. AMR was lower in the CADe-first group compared

with the HDWL-first group (20.12 % [34/169] versus 31.25 % [45/144];

OR, 1.8048; 95 % CI: 1.0780 to 3.0217; p = 0.0247). SSL miss rate was

lower in the CADe-first group (7.14 % [1/14]) versus the HDWL-first group

(42.11 % [8/19]; p = 0.0482). First-pass APC was higher in the CADe-first

group (1.19 (SD), 2.03 versus 0.90 (SD) 1.55; p = 0.0323). First-pass

ADR was 50.44 % in the CADe-first group and 43.64 % in the HDWL-first

group (p = 0.3091). The authors concluded that in this multi-center

tandem colonoscopy RCT, they showed a decrease in AMR and SSL

miss rate and an increase in 1st-pass APC with the use of a CADe-

system when compared with HDWL colonoscopy alone. These

researchers stated that CADe has the potential to decrease inter-provider

variability in colonoscopy quality by reducing AMR, even in experienced

providers.

The authors stated that this study had several drawbacks. First, this trial

was not powered to detect a difference in ADR. Second, the tandem

colonoscopy design used in this trial showed important insights regarding

CADe performance; however, was somewhat limited in terms of

generalizability to the real-world clinical setting. Endoscopists could not

be blinded to a patient’s group assignment while conducting each

withdrawal. It was possible that endoscopist performance was influenced

by being observed or that endoscopists who participated for the length of

the study became over-reliant on CADe during withdrawal, leading to an

over-estimation or under-estimate of CADe performance. However, these

effects should generally have been balanced across both randomization

groups. Third, this trial only included experienced endoscopists with a

high baseline ADR at U.S. academic medical centers. It was less clear

how CADe-assisted colonoscopy would affect endoscopy performance

for trainees, for junior endoscopists, and in community settings. Some

studies suggested the most benefit for CADe for endoscopists with limited

experience or high procedure volume and for patients who present with a

high polyp burden. Fourth, this study employed a 2nd monitor adjacent to

the primary endoscopy monitor, similar to other early trials. However,

recent studies, including the authors’ previous tandem colonoscopy study,

had used a single-monitor setup. Although a dual-monitor setup may be

less burdensome if latency of the CADe system is above a detectable

visible threshold, it may also have negative effects on endoscopist gaze

pattern. These investigators suspected a single-monitor setup may be

preferred in the long run as it allows for easier integration of the

technology.

Mehta et al (2023) stated that as AI-assisted diagnosis gained immense

popularity, it is imperative to consider its use and effectiveness in the

early diagnosis of CRC, responsible for over 1.8 million cases and

881,000 deaths globally, as reported in 2018. Improved adenoma

detection rate, as well as better characterizations of polyps, are

significant advantages of AIC. This systematic review examined the

effectiveness of AI-assisted colonoscopy (AIC) in the early diagnosis of

CRC as compared to conventional colonoscopy. Electronic databases

such as PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (WOS) were

reviewed for original studies (RCTs, observational studies), systematic

reviews, and meta-analysis between 2017 and 2022 employing MESH

terminology in a broad search strategy. All searches were carried out and

analyzed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic

Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology and were conducted

in November, 2022. A data extraction form based on the Cochrane

Consumers and Communication Review group's extraction template for

quality assessment and evidence synthesis was used for data extraction.

All included studies considered for bias and ethical criteria and provided

valuable evidence to answer the research question. The database

search identified 218 studies, including 87 from PubMed, 60 from

SCOPUS, and 71 from Web of Science databases. The retrieved studies

from the databases were imported to Rayyan software and a duplicate

article check was performed, all duplicate articles were removed after

careful evaluation of the data. The abstract and full-text screening was

performed in accordance with the following eligibility criteria: STROBE for

observational studies; PRISMA for review articles, ENTREQ for narrative

studies; and modified JADAD for RCTs. This yielded 15 studies that met

the requirements for the systematic review and were finally included in

the review. The authors concluded that AIC was a safe, highly effective

screening tool that can increase the detection rate of adenomas, and

polyps resulting in early diagnosis of CRC in adults when compared to

conventional colonoscopy. Moreover, these researchers stated that the

findings of this systematic review prompted further large-scale research

to examine the effectiveness in accordance with gender, race, and

socioeconomic status as well as its influence on prognosis and survival

rate.

Shah et al (2023) noted that multiple computer-aided techniques utilizing

AI have been created to improve the detection of polyps during

colonoscopy; thus, reducing the incidence of CRC. While adenoma

detection rates (ADR) and polyp detection rates (PDR) are important

colonoscopy quality indicators, AMR may better quantify missed lesions,

which can ultimately lead to interval CRC. In a systematic review and

meta-analysis, these investigators examined the effectiveness of

computer-aided colonoscopy (CAC) with respect to AMR, ADR, and PDR

in RCTs. These researchers carried out a comprehensive, systematic

literature search across multiple databases in September of 2022 to

identify RCTs that compared CAC with traditional colonoscopy. Primary

outcomes were AMR, ADR, and PDR. A total of 14 studies totaling

10,928 patients were included in the final analysis. There was a 65 %

reduction in the adenoma miss rate with CAC (OR, 0.35; 95 % CI: 0.25 to

0.49, p < 0.001, I2 = 50 %). There was a 78 % reduction in the sessile

serrated lesion miss rate with CAC (OR, 0.22; 95 % CI: 0.08 to 0.65, p <

0.01, I2 = 0 %). There was a 52 % increase in ADR in the CAC group

compared with the control group (OR, 1.52; 95 % CI: 1.39 to 1.67, p =

0.04, I2 = 47 %). There was 93 % increase in the number of adenomas

greater than 10 mm detected per colonoscopy with CAC (OR 1.93; 95 %

CI: 1.18 to 3.16, p < 0.01, I2 = 0 %). The authors concluded that findings

of the present study showed the promise of CAC in improving AMR, ADR,

PDR across a spectrum of size and morphological lesion characteristics.

Spadaccini et al (2023) stated that CRC is the 3rd most common cancer

worldwide, with the highest incidence reported in high-income countries.

However, because of the slow progression of neoplastic precursors,

along with the opportunity for their endoscopic detection and resection, a

well-designed endoscopic screening program is expected to strongly

decrease CRC incidence and mortality. In this regard, quality of

colonoscopy has been clearly related with the risk of post-colonoscopy

CRC. Recently, the development of AI applications in the medical field

has been growing in interest. Through machine learning processes, and,

more recently, DL, if a very high numbers of learning samples are

available, AI systems may automatically extract specific features from

endoscopic images/videos without human intervention, helping the

endoscopists in different aspects of their daily practice. The aim of this

review is to summarize the current knowledge on AI-aided endoscopy,

and to outline its potential role in colorectal cancer prevention. These

researchers stated that preliminary data on both computer-aided

characterization (CADx) systems as well as AI-assisted quality-control

systems are promising; however, the lack of high-quality clinical studies

prevents any reliable conclusion. Therefore, such studies should be

considered as a priority in future research agendas. The steps to be

carried out are still many; however, the path does not appear so steep

anymore.

Mansur et al (2023) noted that AI is a branch of computer science that

employs optimization, probabilistic and statistical approaches to analyze

and make predictions based on a vast amount of data. In recent years,

AI has revolutionized the field of oncology and spearheaded novel

approaches in the management of various cancers, including CRC.

Notably, the use of AI to diagnose, prognosticate, and predict response to

therapy in CRC, is gaining traction and proving to be promising. There

have also been several advancements in AI technologies to help predict

metastases in CRC and in CAD Systems to improve miss rates for

colorectal neoplasia. These investigators stated that while promising, the

use of AI in clinical medicine is still at an early stage. One of the biggest

drawbacks with AI is that models tend to be limited by the amount and

quality of available labeled data for model development and validation.

The generalizability of the models is also based on the type of data used

in training. Large datasets that are ethnographically diverse will be

needed to ensure that models can be applied for decision-making in

diverse patient populations. In addition, there is a need to establish

ethical guidelines before models can ever be widely employed to ensure

their appropriate use and access. Another issue with the clinical

application of AI and machine learning (ML) is the “black box” problem, in

which researcher are able to see the inputs and outputs of a model, but

not the variables that are used by the model to generate those outputs.

More efforts are needed to make the algorithms, especially DL

algorithms, interpretable to clinicians and to allow streamlining of data

pre-processing. Furthermore, most of the studies have a retrospective

design, and more evidence on the effectiveness of AI is needed from

prospective, multi-center studies. Finally, standards need to be

established for the required accuracy rates to ensure the safe use and

legality of AI technology. Efforts are needed to ensure that sensitive data

are kept confidential. Nonetheless, the potential of AI in medicine, and

specifically CRC is promising. The authors concluded that while there

remains challenges to overcome with regards to the generalizability,

validation, and clinical application of these technologies, future

developments may eventually result in improved outcomes and to a

paradigm shift in how patients with suspected or diagnosed CRC are

cared for.

Sekiguchi et al (2025) stated that ensuring the high quality of

colonoscopies in CRC screening is crucial in reducing CRC. Recently,

computer-aided detection systems (CADe) that employ AI have attracted

much attention as potentially useful tools for improving lesion detection in

colonoscopy. However, evidence on the effectiveness of CADe in CRC

screening is lacking. These investigators have planned a multi-national,

multi-center, RCT in the Asia-Pacific region to examine if colonoscopy

with CADe (test method) will yield higher lesion detection (primary

endpoint: adenoma detection rate) than colonoscopy without CADe

(standard method) in CRC screening populations. The study will include

1,400 participants aged 50 to 79 years who are due to undergo

colonoscopy for CRC screening, whether as a primary screening

colonoscopy or following a positive FIT. If the effectiveness of CADe is

proven from this study, the use of CADe in colonoscopy for CRC

screening will become standard, resulting in improved CRC screening.

Endo et al (2025) noted that CT colonography is increasingly recognized

as a valuable modality for diagnosing colorectal lesions; however, the

interpretation work-load remains challenging for physicians. Deep

learning (DL)-based AI algorithms have been used for imaging

diagnoses. These researchers examined the sensitivity of neoplastic

lesions in CT colonography images. Lesion location and size were

examined during colonoscopy and a large-scale data-base including a

data-set for AI learning and external validation was created. The DICOM

data used as training data and internal validation data (total 453 patients)

for this study were CRC screening test data from 2 multi-center joint trial

carried out in Japan and data from 2 centers. External validation data

(137 patients) were from other 2 centers. Lesions were categorized into

≥ 6 mm, 6 to 10 mm, and ≥ 10 mm. During this study, these investigators

adopted a neural network structure that was designed based on the faster

R-CNNs to detect colorectal lesion. The sensitivity of detecting colorectal

lesions was verified when 1 and 2 positions were integrated. Internal

validation yielded sensitivity of 0.815, 0.738, and 0.883 for lesions ≥ 6

mm, 6 to 10 mm, and ≥ 10 mm, respectively, with a false lesion limit of 3.

Two external validation produced rates of 0.705 and 0.707, 0.575 and

0.573, and 0.760 and 0.779 for each lesion category. Combining 2

positions for each patient in calculating the sensitivity resulted in

significantly improved rates for each lesion category. The authors

concluded that the sensitivity of CT colonography images using the AI

algorithm was improved by integrating evaluations in 2 positions. These

researchers stated that in the future, validation experiments involving

radiologists who can interpret images as well as AI to determine the

auxiliary diagnosis can reduce the work-load of physicians.

The authors stated that this study had several drawbacks. First, these

investigators were unable to assess the specificity due to the absence of

negative cases in the external validation dataset. In future research,

these researchers believe it is necessary to carry out validation using a

large-scale data-set that includes negative cases, and to examine the

specificity more accurately along with the sensitivity. Second, this trial did

not validate how physicians interpreted the lesions identified by the AI

algorithm. The sensitivity of the AI algorithm was evaluated based on its

ability to detect lesions that were endoscopically confirmed. In future

studies, it will be necessary to carry out evaluations that incorporate

physicians' diagnoses to examine the performance of the AI algorithm

more accurately. Third, the authors did not examine the threshold value

and allowed number of false-positive lesions during the interpretation of

the actual images. Fourth, this study did not examine the cost-

effectiveness or feasibility of implementing dual-position imaging and

diagnosis using AI algorithms in real-world clinical settings. Given the

current radiologist shortage, cost and operational considerations are

especially important.

Hassan et al (2025) stated that colonoscopy, a crucial procedure for

detecting and removing colorectal polyps, has seen transformative

advancements via the use of AI, specifically in CADe and CADx. These

tools enhance real-time detection and characterization of lesions,

potentially reducing human error, and standardizing the quality of

colonoscopy across endoscopists. CADe has proven effective in

increasing adenoma detection rate, potentially reducing long-term CRC

incidence. However, CADe's benefits are accompanied by challenges,

such as potentially longer procedure times, increased non-neoplastic

polyp resections, and a higher surveillance burden. CADx, while

promising in differentiating neoplastic and non-neoplastic diminutive

polyps, encounters limitations in accuracy, especially in the proximal

colon. Real-world data also showed gaps between trial effectiveness and

practical outcomes, emphasizing the need for further research in

uncontrolled settings. Moreover, CADx limited specificity and binary

output underscore the necessity for explainable AI to gain endoscopists'

trust. The authors examined the benefits, harms, and limitations of AI for

colon cancer screening, surveillance, and treatment; focusing on CADe

and CADx systems for lesion detection and characterization, respectively,

while addressing challenges in integrating these technologies into clinical

practice.

Blood-Based Protein Biomarkers for Screening of Colon Cancer

Beacon Biomedical, Inc. offers the BeScreened-CRC, an ELISA-based

multiplex screening test, that involves testing three blood-based tumor-

associated protein biomarkers; an oncoprotein called teratocarcinoma

derived growth factor-1 (TDGF-1, Cripto-1); carcinoembryonic antigen

(CEA), a well-established biomarker associated with CRC; and an

extracellular matrix (ECM) protein involved in early stage tumor stroma

changes. These three proteins target immunological activities associated

with CRC tumorigenesis; generation, invasion, progression, and

migration. This test is designed for those patients over 45 years of age

who are at typical average-risk for CRC and who are unwilling or unable

to participate in current recommended fecal-based CRC screening tests

and colonoscopy procedures. Results are reported as either Negative of

Positive for the likely presence of CRC. Patients who receive negative

results are recommended to stay compliant with existing, patient specific

screening guidance. Patients who receive positive results are

recommended to follow-up with their physician for consult and to

schedule a screening colonoscopy. BeScreened-CRC is not a diagnostic

test for CRC. It is a screening test that aides in the detection of colorectal

cancer and is not intended to replace a colonoscopy. Beacon Biomedical

reports 94.6% accuracy at determining the likely presence or absence of

CRC. The test kit can be mailed to the patient’s home or healthcare

providers office. Beacon Biomedical will contact the patient at home to

schedule an at-home blood draw if warranted.

Bhardwaj et al. (2020) state that blood-based protein biomarker

signatures might be an alternative or supplement to existing methods for

early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) for population-based

screening. The authors worked to obtain a protein biomarker signature for

early detection of CRC and its precursor advanced adenoma (AA). In a

two-stage design, 270 protein markers were measured by liquid

chromatography/multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry in

plasma samples of discovery and validation sets. In the discovery set

consisting of 100 newly diagnosed CRC cases and 100 age- and sex-

matched controls free of neoplasm at screening colonoscopy, the

algorithms predicting the presence of early- or late-stage CRC were

derived by Lasso regression and .632 + bootstrap. The prediction

algorithms were then externally validated in an independent validation set

consisting of participants of screening colonoscopy including 56

participants with CRC, 99 with AA and 99 controls without any colorectal

neoplasms. Three different signatures for all-, early- and late-stage CRC

consisting of five-, three- and eight-protein markers were obtained in the

discovery set with areas under the curves (AUCs) after .632 + bootstrap

adjustment of 0.85, 0.83 and 0.96, respectively. External validation in the

representative screening population yielded AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70-

0.86), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66-0.89) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70-0.89) for all-,

early- and late-stage CRCs, respectively. The three-marker early-stage

algorithm yielded an AUC of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.56-0.73) for detection of AA

in the validation set. Although not yet competitive with available stool-

based tests for CRC early detection, the identified proteins may

contribute to the development of powerful blood-based tests for early

detection of CRC and its precursors AAs.

An UpToDate review on “Tests for screening for colorectal cancer”

(Doubeni, 2020) state that “there is no evidence for the effectiveness of

screening with plasma or serum markers in reducing the risk of CRC

death. Available blood-based markers primarily detect CRC, particularly

more advanced CRC, rather than precancerous lesions. Their role in

early detection is unclear, and they are not included in major society

guidelines for screening. Blood tests for gene expression are in

development for patients unwilling to undergo initial colonoscopy. The

potential to utilize combinations of serum markers has also been

explored, but well-designed studies in unselected screening populations

are needed to determine if there is clinical relevance”. Furthermore,

carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is not useful as a screening test for

CRC. It may; however, be used for surveillance of patients with CRC.

Capsule Endoscopy for Colorectal Cancer Screening

Kjolhede and colleagues (2021) noted that colon capsule endoscopy

(CCE) is a technology that might contribute to CRC screening programs

as a filter test between fecal immunochemical testing and standard

colonoscopy. These investigators systematically reviewed the literature

for studies examining the diagnostic yield of 2nd-generation CCE

compared with standard colonoscopy. They carried out a systematic

literature search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Study

characteristics including quality of bowel preparation and completeness of

CCE transits were extracted. Per-patient sensitivity and specificity were

extracted for polyps (any size, greater than or equal to 10 mm, greater

than or equal to 6 mm) and lesion characteristics. Meta-analyses of

diagnostic yield were performed. The literature search revealed 1,077

unique papers and 12 studies were included. Studies involved a total of

2,199 patients, of whom 1,898 were included in analyses. The rate of

patients with adequate bowel preparation varied from 40 % to 100 %.

The rates of complete CCE transit varied from 57 % to 100 %. The meta-

analyses demonstrated that mean (95 % CI) sensitivity, specificity, and

diagnostic odds ratio were: 0.85 (0.73 to 0.92), 0.85 (0.70 to 0.93), and

30.5 (16.2 to 57.2), respectively, for polyps of any size; 0.87 (0.82 to

0.90), 0.95 (0.92 to 0.97), and 136.0 (70.6 to 262.1), respectively, for

polyps greater than or equal to 10 mm; and 0.87 (0.83 to 0.90), 0.88 (0.75

to 0.95), and 51.1 (19.8 to 131.8), respectively, for polyps greater than or

equal to 6 mm. No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported for CCE.

The authors concluded that CCE had high sensitivity and specificity for

per-patient polyps compared with standard colonoscopy; however, the

relatively high rate of incomplete investigations limited the application of

CCE in a CRC screening setting.

Houwen and Dekker (2021) noted that the European Union recommends

FIT as the preferred method for population-based screening programs,

followed by colonoscopy in FIT-positive individuals. Such FIT-based

programs have high participation rates, and a PPV of approximately 40

%, which makes it not so attractive to follow a positive FIT by another

non-invasive test where no therapy nor pathology-based diagnosis is

possible. Thus, CCE might only be a sensible option for those FIT-

positive individuals who are unwilling to undergo colonoscopy. In other

countries, depending on many factors like availability of endoscopy

services and finances, the preferred screening methods might be

different, and primary screening by colonoscopy may be recommended.

In these areas, participation-rates could possibly be increased by offering

CCE as an alternative screening method; however, data of prospective

studies on aspects like participation rates, accuracy, patient burden,

logistics and cost-effectivity are needed first

In addition, European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and

European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology

(ESGAR)’s guideline on “Imaging alternatives to colonoscopy: CT

colonography and colon capsule” (Spada et al, 2021) did not suggest

CCE as a 1st-line screening test for CRC (Weak recommendation, low-

quality evidence).

Furthermore, an UpToDate review on “Tests for screening for colorectal

cancer” (Doubeni, 2021b) states that “Colon capsule endoscopy is

approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use only in

patients who had an incomplete colonoscopy, not as a screening option

by itself. During the test, the patient swallows a capsule containing tiny

wireless video cameras that take images as the capsule traverses the

colon. Colon capsule endoscopy requires a bowel preparation; however,

it does not require sedation or dietary or medication adjustments. This

test appears to have a sensitivity and specificity similar to colonoscopy”.

CD3 Immuno-Staining for Screening of Colon Cancer

Mima et al (2015) noted that evidence indicates a complex link between

gut microbiome, immunity, and intestinal tumorigenesis. To target the

microbiota and immunity for colorectal cancer prevention and therapy, a

better understanding of the relationship between microorganisms and

immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is needed. Experimental

evidence suggested that Fusobacterium nucleatum (F nucleatum) may

promote colonic neoplasia development by down-regulating antitumor T

cell-mediated adaptive immunity. These researchers tested the

hypothesis that a greater amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma

tissue is associated with a lower density of T cells in tumor tissue. A

cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 598 rectal and colon

carcinoma cases in 2 US nationwide prospective cohort studies with

follow-up through 2006, the Nurses' Health Study (participants enrolled in

1976) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (participants enrolled

in 1986). Tissue collection and processing were performed from 2002

through 2008, and immunity assessment, 2008 through 2009. From 2013

through 2014, the amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue

was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay; these

investigators equally dichotomized positive cases (high versus low).

Multi-variable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted in 2014

to assess associations of the amount of F nucleatum with densities

(quartiles) of T cells in tumor tissue, controlling for clinical and tumor

molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island

methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1)

methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation status. They

adjusted the 2-sided α level to 0.013 for multiple hypothesis testing.

Densities of CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO (protein tyrosine phosphatase

receptor type C [PTPRC])+, and FOXP3+ T cells in tumor tissue,

determined by means of tissue microarray immuno-histochemical

analysis and computer-assisted image analysis. F nucleatum was

detected in colorectal carcinoma tissue in 76 (13 %) of 598 cases.

Compared with F nucleatum-negative cases, F nucleatum-high cases

were inversely associated with the density of CD3+ T cells (for a unit

increase in quartile categories of CD3+ T cells as an outcome: multi-

variable odds ratio, 0.47 [95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.26 to 0.87]; p for

trend = 0.006). The amount of F nucleatum was not significantly

associated with the density of CD8+, CD45RO+, or FOXP3+ T cells (P for

trend = 0.24, 0.88, and 0.014, respectively). The authors concluded that

the amount of tissue F nucleatum is inversely associated with CD3+ T-cell

density in colorectal carcinoma tissue. On validation, their human

population data may provide an impetus for further investigations on

potential interactive roles of Fusobacterium and host immunity in colon

carcinogenesis.

Turksma et al (2016) examined the prognostic and predictive value of

tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in colon cancer in a cohort of patients

who previously took part in a trial on adjuvant active specific

immunotherapy (ASI). These researchers determined the number and

location of CD3 and CD8 positive T cells in archival tumor samples of 106

colon cancers. They correlated stromal and epithelial TIL numbers with

tumor stage and treatment and determined the effects on disease-specific

survival (DSS) and recurrence-free interval (RFI). On the basis of the

data presented, these investigators concluded that (i) high numbers of

stromal CD3 T cells have positive prognostic value measured as DSS

for patients with stage II microsatellite-stable tumors, and (ii) high

numbers of epithelial CD8-positive T cells have positive prognostic

value measured as RFI for the group of patients with stage II

microsatellite-stable tumors as well as for the whole group (so stage II

plus stage III together). Furthermore, they concluded that high numbers

of pre-existing stromal CD3-positive T cells are of positive predictive

value in adjuvant ASI treatment measured as DSS as well as RFI. The

authors concluded that ASI therapy may contribute to an improved DSS

and RFI in patients with microsatellite-stable colon tumors harboring high

numbers of pre-existing stromal CD3(+) TIL; validation in future clinical

trials is awaited.

Hagland et al (2017) tested the feasibility of conducting parallel analyses

of circulating T-cells in blood and intra-tumoral T-cells in colorectal

cancer. A pre-operative “liquid biopsy” to determine immune status would

facilitate clinical decision-making. A total of 18 patients with stage I-III

colorectal cancer (CRC) were included. Blood was analyzed for T-cell

type (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+) and count using flow cytometry. Intra-

tumoral T-cells were stained using immunohistochemistry and quantified

by digital pathology. Tumor location was defined as invasive front (IF) or

tumor center (TC). The number of CD3+ and CD4+ T-cells in pre-surgical

blood samples correlated with the number of CD3+ T-cells found in the IF

(Spearman ϱ = 0.558, p < 0.05 and 0.598, p < 0.01, respectively) and

CD3+ in the TC (ϱ = 0.496, p < 0.05, and ϱ = 0.637, p < 0.01,

respectively). A strong correlation was found between CD4+ cells in

blood and CD8+ T-cells found in the TC and IF (ϱ = 0.602 and ϱ = 0.591,

p < 0.01). The authors concluded that there is a correlation between

blood CD3+ and CD4+ T-cells and the T-cells found at the TC and IF.

Furthermore, National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s clinical practice

guideline on “Colon cancer” (Version 2.2017) does not mention CD3

immuno-staining as a management tool.

Redwood and colleagues (2016) evaluated the accuracy of a multi-target

stool DNA test (MT-sDNA) compared with FIT for hemoglobin for

detection of screening-relevant colorectal neoplasia (SRN) in Alaska

Native people, who have among the world's highest rates of CRC and

limited access to conventional screening approaches. These researchers

performed a prospective, cross-sectional study of asymptomatic Alaska

Native adults aged 40 to 85 years and older undergoing screening or

surveillance colonoscopy between February 6, 2012, and August 7,

2014. Among 868 enrolled participants, 661 completed the study (403

[61 %] women). Overall, SRN detection by MT-sDNA (49 %) was

superior to that by FIT (28 %; p < 0.001); in the screening group, SRN

detection rates were 50 % and 31 %, respectively (p = 0.01). Multi-target

stool DNA testing detected 62 % of adenomas 2 cm or larger versus 29 %

by FIT (p = 0.05). Sensitivity by MT-sDNA increased with adenoma size

(to 80 % for lesions greater than or equal to 3 cm; p = 0.01 for trend) and

substantially exceeded FIT sensitivity at all adenoma sizes. For sessile

serrated polyps larger than 1 cm (n = 9), detection was 67 % by MT-

sDNA versus 11 % by FIT (p = 0.07). For CRC (n = 10), detection was

100 % by MT-sDNA versus 80 % by FIT (p = 0.48). Specificities were 93

% and 96 %, respectively (p = 0.03). The authors concluded that the

sensitivity of MT-sDNA for cancer and larger polyps was high and

significantly greater than that of FIT for polyps of any size, while

specificity was slightly higher with FIT. They stated that these findings

could translate into high cumulative neoplasm detection rates on serial

testing within a screening program; the MT-sDNA represents a potential

strategy to expand CRC screening and reduce CRC incidence and

mortality, especially where access to endoscopy is limited. These

investigators stated that further consideration and evaluation of the

optimal test frequency, physician and patient acceptance, cost-

effectiveness, and logistic algorithms for use and distribution within the

Alaska Tribal Health System are needed.

Imperiale et al (2014) compared a non-invasive, multi-target stool DNA

test with a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) in persons at average risk for

CRC. The DNA test includes quantitative molecular assays for KRAS

mutations, aberrant NDRG4 and BMP3 methylation, and β-actin, plus a

hemoglobin immunoassay. Results were generated with the use of a

logistic-regression algorithm, with values of 183 or more considered to be

positive. Fecal immunochemical test values of more than 100 ng of

hemoglobin per milliliter of buffer were considered to be positive. Tests

were processed independently of colonoscopic findings. Of the 9,989

participants who could be evaluated, 65 (0.7 %) had CRC and 757 (7.6

%) had advanced pre-cancerous lesions (advanced adenomas or sessile

serrated polyps measuring greater than or equal to 1 cm in the greatest

dimension) on colonoscopy. The sensitivity for detecting CRC was 92.3

% with DNA testing and 73.8 % with FIT (p = 0.002). The sensitivity for

detecting advanced pre-cancerous lesions was 42.4 % with DNA testing

and 23.8 % with FIT (p < 0.001). The rate of detection of polyps with

high-grade dysplasia was 69.2 % with DNA testing and 46.2 % with FIT (p

= 0.004); the rates of detection of serrated sessile polyps measuring 1 cm

or more were 42.4 % and 5.1 %, respectively (p < 0.001). Specificities

with DNA testing and FIT were 86.6 % and 94.9 %, respectively, among

participants with non-advanced or negative findings (p < 0.001) and 89.8

% and 96.4 %, respectively, among those with negative results on

colonoscopy (p < 0.001). The numbers of persons who would need to be

screened to detect 1 cancer were 154 with colonoscopy, 166 with DNA

testing, and 208 with FIT. The authors concluded that in asymptomatic

persons at average risk for CRC, multi-target stool DNA testing detected

significantly more cancers than did FIT but had more false-positive

results.

In an editorial that accompanied the afore-mentioned study, Robertson

and Dominitz (2014) stated that “The new multitarget stool DNA test is

clearly an improvement over its predecessors, and the results of this

study will help to inform the current effort of the U.S. Preventive Services

Task Force to reevaluate screening tests. Comparative-effectiveness

studies are now needed to clarify the role of stool DNA testing with

respect to programmatic screening with other test options. Only through

a better understanding of other key factors, such as the screening

interval, adherence, cost, and diagnostic evaluation of positive results,

can we determine the appropriate place for stool DNA testing on the

screening menu”.

Onieva-Garcia and colleagues (2015) evaluated the available evidence

on the validity, diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of the multi-target

™

DNA test in feces (Cologuard ) for screening for colorectal cancer

(CRC). A systematic review was performed by consulting MedLine,

EMBASE and Web of Science to July 2014. Studies on diagnostic tests

were selected that evaluated the test in asymptomatic adults who

underwent CRC screening. The quality and risk of bias was assessed

using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. The

level of evidence was defined according to the National Institute for

Health and Clinical Excellence. A qualitative synthesis was conducted. A

total of 299 literature references were identified, including 1 synthesis

report and 5 diagnostic test studies; 3 of the 5 studies had a case-control

design in Sackett phase II and were of moderate quality, and 2 had a

prospective design in Sacket phase III and were of high quality. The

sensitivity for detecting CRC was greater than 90 %, but only 40 % for

detecting advanced adenomas. The test provided conclusive diagnostic

evidence to rule out CRC (negative likelihood ratio, LR-: 0.02 to 0.09),

although it was not useful for ruling out advanced adenoma (LR-: 0.5 to

™

0.7). The authors concluded that Cologuard test is a valid screening

test for ruling out cancerous lesions but is suboptimal for ruling out

precancerous lesions. They stated that there is no evidence in terms of

mortality, survival or cost-effectiveness.

An UpToDate review on “Tests for screening for colorectal cancer: Stool

tests, radiologic imaging and endoscopy” (Doubeni, 2016) states that

“Cologuard has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration

(FDA) in August 2014, as a screening test for colorectal carcinoma to be

followed, when abnormal, by diagnostic colonoscopy. The implications of

"false positives," abnormal DNA testing in patients who are not found to

have colonic lesions on colonoscopy, is uncertain. In a study of

screening with 3 modalities (stool DNA, colonoscopy, and fecal

immunochemical tests) in average-risk patients, nearly 10 % of those with

an entirely negative colonoscopy had a positive stool DNA test. It is not

known whether these positive tests are clinically important, for example,

by representing carcinomas elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract or

mucosal predisposition to cancer. The appropriate interval between

screening fecal DNA tests is unknown. As of October 2014 the Centers

for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) include coverage for this test

once every 3 years for asymptomatic Medicare beneficiaries age 50 to 84

years at average risk for CRC. Stool DNA testing is not currently

incorporated into screening guidelines from the US Preventive Services

Task Force (USPSTF), which were prepared before evidence regarding

the current generation fecal test was available”.

Cologuard Plus

Liscu, et al. (2024) stated that biomarkers in CRC are of great interest in

the current literature due to improvements in techniques such as liquid

biopsy and next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, screening

methods vary globally, with multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA)

predominantly used in the U.S. and, more recently, the Cologuard Plus;

biomarkers such as the Galectins family and septins show promise in

early detection. Gut microbiome assessments, such as Fusobacterium

nucleatum, are under intense exploration. Diagnostic tests, such as

circulating DNA analysis via NGS, exhibit effectiveness and are being

increasingly adopted. Circulating tumor cells emerge as potential

alternatives to traditional methods in terms of diagnosis and prognosis.

Imperiale, et al. (2024) evaluated the performance of a next-generation

multitarget stool DNA test for colorectal cancer screening. This test

includes assessments of DNA molecular markers and hemoglobin levels

to enhance specificity and sensitivity compared to previous versions and

the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The study was conducted at 186

sites across the United States, involving 20,176 participants out of 26,758

enrolled. Participants were asymptomatic individuals aged 40 or older

scheduled for screening colonoscopy. Exclusions included those with a

history of colorectal cancer, advanced precancerous lesions, hereditary

cancer syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, recent positive stool

tests, or recent colonoscopy. The primary objective was to determine the

sensitivity of the next-generation test for colorectal cancer and its

specificity for advanced neoplasia. Secondary objectives included

sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions and specificity for

nonneoplastic findings or negative colonoscopy, and a comparison with

FIT. The next-generation test showed a sensitivity of 93.9% for colorectal

cancer and 43.4% for advanced precancerous lesions. Specificity for

advanced neoplasia was 90.6% and for nonneoplastic findings or

negative colonoscopy was 92.7%. In comparison, FIT had a sensitivity of

67.3% for colorectal cancer and 23.3% for advanced precancerous

lesions, with specificities of 94.8% for advanced neoplasia and 95.7% for

nonneoplastic findings or negative colonoscopy. Sensitivity for colorectal

cancer did not vary significantly by disease stage or location. Sensitivity

for advanced precancerous lesions was consistent across age groups

and lesion subtypes. Specificity for advanced neoplasia was higher in

younger participants, with a decrease observed in older age groups. For

colorectal cancer, the positive predictive value was 3.4% and the negative

predictive value was 99.97%. For advanced neoplasia, the positive

predictive value was 37.7% and the negative predictive value was 93.0%.

The authors found that the next-generation multitarget stool DNA test

demonstrated superior sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer and

advanced precancerous lesions compared to FIT. However, FIT had

higher specificity for advanced neoplasia and nonneoplastic findings or

negative colonoscopy. Strengths of the study are that it was conducted in

a large and diverse participant population, representative of the U.S.

screening-eligible population. Another strength was the use of central,

blinded adjudication of colorectal cancers ensured diagnostic accuracy.

Limitations of the study include: 1) a high proportion of participants whose

samples could not be evaluated, possibly due to the COVID-19

pandemic; 2) there was no direct comparison with the current version of

the multitarget stool DNA test. The authors concluded that the next-

generation multitarget stool DNA test showed high sensitivity for

colorectal cancer and advanced precancerous lesions, making it a

valuable tool for colorectal cancer screening. However, FIT remains

superior in specificity for advanced neoplasia.

The authors stated that a drawback of this trial was the relatively high

proportion of individuals who provided informed consent and were

enrolled but whose samples could not be examined according to the

protocol. A contributing factor may have been conduct of the study during

the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which probably affected

enrollment and access to colonoscopy. Multiple imputation analyses that

accounted for all the subjects showed results consistent with those from

the population of participants with evaluable samples. Another drawback

was that these researchers did not directly compare the performance of

the next-generation multi-target stool DNA test with the current version of

the multi-target stool DNA test. Therefore, the results from this study

could not be reliably compared with published findings for the multi-target

stool DNA test that is currently available for screening purposes, and valid

comparisons would require the assessment of both tests in the same

persons and specimens concurrently in the context of screening.

In an editorial that accompanied the afore-mentioned study by Imperiale,

et al. (2024), Carethers (2024) stated that screening tests for CRC have

evolved to include stool-based, endoscopic and image-based, and blood-

based methods, with minimal thresholds for sensitivity and specificity for

CRC set by the baseline characteristics of FIT. Although multiple tests

have been developed over time and vary in cost-effectiveness for CRC

screening, the best screening test is the one that gets completed by the

patient. Most of the recommended tests, including the 2 newer tests

assessed in the studies now published in the Journal, improved on the

sensitivity and approached the specificity of FIT, such that these tests

appeared to be at least as effective as FIT. Adherence to screening is a

key factor, and ease of test use may contribute to increased adherence.

Cost-effectiveness and the selection of the testing interval may play roles

in adherence, especially in populations that already have lower rates of

adherence to CRC screening than the general population. Adherence to

screening varies according to age group, including persons in the 45 to

49 years age group who are now eligible for average-risk screening. The

editorialist hoped that these newer tests will increase use and adherence

and elevate the percentage of the population undergoing screening in

order to reduce deaths from CRC.

Colon AiQ

Colon AiQ (Breakthrough Genomics) is a cell-free DNA (cfDNA),

methylation-based quantitative PCR assay that evaluates SEPTIN9,

IKZF1, BCAT1, VAV3, and BCAN biomarkers in plasma. The test uses

DNA methylation technology to find small traces of tumor cfDNA in the

blood. The results are interpreted using an AI-powered computer analysis

and reported as presence or absence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). If

a patient receives a ‘positive’ finding that a CRC cancer signal has been

detected, then it is recommended that they consult with their healthcare

provider and seek further testing including a colonoscopy.

Blood-based colorectal cancer screening tests is an emerging option that

has been evaluated by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network

(NCCN, 2024). Per NCCN, the methylation status of the SEPTIN9

(SEPT9) gene has been shown to distinguish CRC tissue from normal

surrounding tissue, and circulating methylated SEPT9 DNA in plasma is a

biomarker for CRC. A multicenter study compared the fecal

immunochemical test (FIT) and a SEPT9 DNA methylated blood test for

CRC screening of 102 patients with identified CRC, and found that the

specificity for CRC detection was higher for FIT (97.4% vs. 81.5%,

respectively) but the sensitivity for CRC detection was not significantly

different (68% vs. 73.3%, respectively). NCCN does not mention using

cell-free DNA (cfDNA), methylation-based quantitative PCR assay that

evaluates IKZF1, BCAT1, VAV3, and BCAN biomarkers in plasma for

CRC screening.

Colorectal Cancer Screening After Age of 85 Years

The USPSTF (2021) updated its 2016 recommendation on screening for

CRC by commissioning a systematic review to examine the benefits and

harms of screening for CRC in adults 40 years or older. The review also

examined if these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity.

Furthermore, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the

Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Colorectal

Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative modeling

on how estimated life-years gained, CRC cases averted, and CRC deaths

averted vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening

strategies. The USPSTF recommended screening for CRC in all adults

aged 50 to 75 years (A recommendation). The USPSTF recommended

screening for CRC in adults aged 45 to 49 years (B recommendation).

The USPSTF recommended that clinicians selectively offer screening for

CRC in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicated that the net

benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining

whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and

clinicians should consider the patient's overall health, prior screening

history, and preferences (C recommendation).

Patel et al (2022) presented an update to the 2017 CRC screening

recommendations from the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal

Cancer, which represents the ACG, the American Gastroenterological

Association (AGA), and the American Society for Gastrointestinal

Endoscopy (ASGE). This update is restricted to addressing the age to

start and stop CRC screening in average-risk individuals and the

recommended screening modalities. Although there is no literature

demonstrating that CRC screening in individuals under age 50 improves

health outcomes such as CRC incidence or CRC-related mortality,

sufficient data support the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force to suggest

average-risk CRC screening begin at age 45. This recommendation is

based on the increasing disease burden among individuals under age 50,

emerging data that the prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia in

individuals ages 45 to 49 approaches rates in individuals 50 to 59, and

modeling studies that demonstrate the benefits of screening outweigh the

potential harms and costs. For individuals ages 76 to 85, the decision to

start or continue screening should be individualized and based on prior

screening history, life expectancy, CRC risk, and personal preference.

Screening is not recommended after age 85.

Colorectal Cancer Screening in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis

Hadjiliadis and colleagues (2018) noted that improved therapy has

substantially increased survival of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF).

However, the risk of CRC in adults with CF is 5- to 10-fold greater

compared to the general population, and 25 to 30 times greater in CF

patients after an organ transplantation. To address this risk, the CF

Foundation (CFF) convened a multi-stakeholder task force to develop

CRC screening recommendations. The 18-member task force consisted

of experts including pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, a social worker,

nurse coordinator, surgeon, epidemiologist, statistician, CF adult, and a

parent. The committee comprised 3 work groups: Cancer Risk,

Transplant, and Procedure and Preparation. A guidelines specialist at the

CFF conducted an evidence synthesis February to March 2016 based on

PubMed literature searches. Task force members conducted additional

56/103

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

independent searches. A total of 1,159 articles were retrieved. After

initial screening, the committee read 198 articles in full and analyzed 123

articles to develop recommendation statements. An independent

decision analysis evaluating the benefits of screening relative to harms

and resources required was conducted by the Department of Public

Health at Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands using the

Microsimulation Screening Analysis model from the Cancer Innervation

and Surveillance Modeling Network. The task force included

recommendation statements in the final guideline only if they reached an

80 % acceptance threshold. The task force made 10 CRC screening

recommendations that emphasize shared, individualized decision-making

and familiarity with CF-specific GI challenges. The task force

recommended colonoscopy as the preferred screening method, initiation

of screening at age 40 years, 5-year re-screening and 3-year surveillance

intervals (unless shorter interval is indicated by individual findings), and a

CF-specific intensive bowel preparation. Organ transplant recipients with

CF should initiate CRC screening at age 30 years within 2 years of the

transplantation because of the additional risk for colon cancer associated

with immunosuppression. The authors concluded that these

recommendations aim to help CF adults, families, primary care

physicians, gastroenterologists, and CF and transplantation centers

address the issue of CRC screening. They differed from guidelines

developed for the general population with respect to the recommended

age of screening initiation, screening method, preparation, and the

interval for repeat screening and surveillance.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) partnered with the CFF to examine

the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening in the CF population, and to

develop screening recommendations from these results. The MISCAN-

Colon model was adjusted to the increased risk of CRC in CF patients

(with and without organ transplant). Colonoscopy every 5 years starting

at age 40 was the optimal strategy for CF patient without an organ

transplant, and colonoscopy starting at age 30 to 35 was suggested for

CF patients with an organ transplant. Methods and recommendations

were described in more detail in the study by Gini and associates (2018).

These investigators modeled 76 colonoscopy screening strategies that

varied the age range and screening interval. The optimal screening

strategy was determined based on a willingness to pay threshold of

$100,000 per life-year gained. Sensitivity and supplementary analyses

were performed, including FIT as an alternative test, earlier ages of

transplantation, and increased rates of colonoscopy complications, to

assess if optimal screening strategies would change. Colonoscopy every

5 years, starting at an age of 40 years, was the optimal colonoscopy

strategy for patients with CF who never received an organ transplant; this

strategy prevented 79 % of deaths from CRC. Among patients with CF

who had received an organ transplant, optimal colonoscopy screening

should commence at an age of 30 or 35 years, depending on the patient's

age at time of transplantation. Annual FIT screening was predicted to be

cost-effective for patients with CF. However, the level of accuracy of the

FIT in this population is unclear. The authors concluded that using a

Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon model, they found screening of

patients with CF for CRC to be cost-effective. Because of the higher risk

of CRC in these patients, screening should start at an earlier age with a

shorter screening interval. The findings of this study (especially those on

FIT screening) may be limited by restricted evidence available for patients

with CF.

An UpToDate review on “Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal

disease” (Sabharwal and Schwarzenberg, 2019) states that “The Cystic

Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) has developed Guidelines for Colorectal

Cancer Screening for adults with CF. The guideline recommends

colonoscopy for screening, beginning at age 40 years, or at 30 years for

those who have had an organ transplant. The screening should be

repeated every five years. If any adenomatous polyps are identified, the

colonoscopy should be repeated in three years or less, depending on

characteristics of the individual case. The guideline includes an intensive

bowel preparation protocol that should be used for CF patients, because

it is very difficult to achieve a satisfactory colonic lavage in these

individuals”.

An UpToDate review on “Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors,

and protective factors” (Macrae, 2019) states that “Patients with cystic

fibrosis have an elevated risk of CRC. In a meta-analysis, the pooled

standardized incidence ratio was 10.91, 95 % CI 8.42-14.11, and it was

two- to five-fold higher following lung transplantation. The Cystic Fibrosis

Foundation (CFF) has developed guidelines for CRC screening for adults

with cystic fibrosis. Although risk estimates are provided, the benefits of

screening for CRC in these patients, who as a group have substantial

comorbidities, are less certain”.

Furthermore, in a Medscape review on “Screening for colorectal cancer in

cystic fibrosis: New risks require new strategies”, Johnson (2019) noted

that the recommendations from the CFF were not considered in the CRC

screening guidelines produced by the ACS, the U.S. Multi-Society Task

Force on Colorectal Cancer, or the ACG. These new guidelines need to

be considered and then reviewed since they are not yet weighted in terms

of the strength of the recommendations or the grades of evidence. That

will need to be carried out by the national societies, because these will

otherwise not necessarily get paid for. Most state legislations default to

the ACS or the ACG guideline.

ColoSense Multi-Target Stool RNA Test

Yang et al (2010) attempted to specifically quantify transcripts of fecal

cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) RNA

expression of CRC and clarified their correlation with clinico-pathological

parameters and survival in combination. Solid fecal samples were

collected and preserved before any treatment. Levels of fecal CK19 and

RPL19 mRNA were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. An

expression level higher than median value was defined as positive.

Between April 2001 and June 2007, a total of 92 patients were recruited.

The levels of both markers increased in a trend as stage. Young patients

(less than 67 years) were correlated with higher rate of CK19+ (p =

0.001), so were higher stages, but with borderline significance (p =

0.051). CK19+ and RPL19+ were highly correlated mutually (p = 0.001).

Neither CK19+ (p = 0.12) nor RPL19+ (p = 0.14) alone was a prognostic

factor of disease-free survival (DFS); however, CK19+/RPL19+ was

shown to be with worse prognosis (p = 0.037), but not an independent

factor in multi-variate analysis with stage. The authors concluded that

both markers were significantly higher in the patients of metastatic

disease. The use of 2 markers would recognize the high-risk group better

than the single marker usage, although not reaching independent status

yet. Multi-target strategy assay was suggested for fecal RNA

examination.

Iannone et al (2016) reported an update of current methods for CRC

screening based on fecal sample analysis. These investigators carried

out a systematic review of the literature in Medline, Embase, and Science

Direct electronic databases. Blood in the stools was the 1st and most

used strategy; FOBT and FIT are the main methods. Both are economic,

easy to perform with high specificity, and low sensitivity. Based on CRC

multi-step process with genetic and epigenetic alterations in large bowel

cell DNA, single mutations or panels of alterations have been detected.

These tests have the advantage of a marked improvement of the

sensitivity when compared to fecal blood; however, high costs, poor

availability, and correct choice of marker panel represent the major

limitations. A specific stool DNA (sDNA) panel including aberrantly

methylated BMP3 and NDRG4 promoter regions, mutant k-ras and β-

actin (a reference gene for human DNA quantity), and an

immunochemical assay for human hemoglobin (Hb) has been recently

approved by the FDA. Novel promising biomarkers for CRC screening

are represented by microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of 18 to 25 nucleotide

non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. Reports on

these fecal biomarkers were case-control studies, and each of them

examined single miRNAs or multi-target panels. On the other hand,

some fecal proteins have been studied as possible CRC screening

markers, even though they showed poor results. Finally, alterations of

estrogen receptor-beta (i.e., dramatic reduction in the early stage of CRC)

have been demonstrated in tissue samples. The authors concluded that

specific investigations are needed in order to add further non-invasive

markers to the panel of CRC screening tools.

Barnell et al (2023) stated that non-invasive tests for CRC screening must

include sensitive detection of CRC and pre-cancerous lesions. These

tests must be validated for the intended-use population, which includes

average-risk individuals 45 years or older. In a phase-III clinical trial,

these researchers compared the sensitivity and specificity of a non-

invasive, multi-target stool RNA (mt-sRNA) test (ColoSense) test with

results from a colonoscopy. This study (the CRC-PREVENT Trial) was a

prospective, blinded, cross-sectional study to support a pre-market

approval (PMA) application for a class-III medical device. A total of 8,920

subjects were identified online using social media platforms and enrolled

from June 2021 to June 2022 using a de-centralized nurse call center. All

subjects completed the mt-sRNA test, which incorporated a commercially

available FIT, concentration of 8 RNA transcripts, and participant-reported

smoking status. Stool samples were collected before subjects completing

a colonoscopy at their local endoscopy center. The mt-sRNA test results

(positive or negative) were compared with index lesions observed on

colonoscopy. Over the course of 12 months, individuals 45 years and

older were enrolled in the clinical trial using the de-centralized recruitment

strategy. Subjects were enrolled from 49 U.S. states, and obtained

colonoscopies at more than 3,800 different endoscopy centers. The

primary outcomes included the sensitivity of the mt-sRNA test for

detecting CRC and advanced adenomas and the specificity for no lesions

on colonoscopy. The mean (range) age of subjects was 55 (45 to 90)

years, with 4 % self-identified as Asian, 11 % as Black, and 7 % as

Hispanic. Of the 8,920 eligible subjects, 36 (0.40 %) had CRC, and 606

(6.8 %) had advanced adenomas. The mt-sRNA test sensitivity for

detecting CRC was 94 %, sensitivity for detecting advanced adenomas

was 46 %, and specificity for no lesions on colonoscopy was 88 %. The

mt-sRNA test showed significant improvement in sensitivity for CRC (94

% versus 78 %; McNemar p = 0.01), and advanced adenomas (46 %

versus 29 %; McNemar p < 0.001) compared with results of the FIT. The

authors concluded that in individuals 45 years and older, the mt-sRNA

test showed high sensitivity for colorectal neoplasia (CRC and advanced

adenoma) with significant improvement in sensitivity relative to the FIT.

Specificity for no lesions on colonoscopy was comparable to existing

molecular diagnostic tests.

The authors stated that this study had several drawbacks. First, center-

to-center variations in colonoscopy quality metrics (e.g., adenoma

detection rate, withdrawal time), which were attributable to a physician’s

experience, technique, and training might have increased the false-

positive and false-negative result rate of the mt-sRNA test. Second, there

were differences in participant treatment (e.g., colonoscopy scheduling,

and bowel preparation) as well as reporting practices in the colonoscopy

and pathology reports (e.g., nomenclature for SSLs, lesion sizing). These

factors could have contributed to the variability of results. Third, the

decentralized approach likely contributed to the high drop-out rate.

In a review on “Cancer screening: Present recommendations, the

development of multi-cancer early development tests, and the prospect of

universal cancer screening”, Gales et al (2024) noted that the mt-sRNA

ColoSense test demonstrated improvements in sensitivity (94 %), but

remains insufficient for advanced adenomas (46 %). However, molecular

tumor finger-printing of early cancers using stool samples remains an

attractive venue in biomarker research. Furthermore, compared to the

standard FOBT, early findings suggested that stool testing can be

expanded to include the previously unscreened upper GI tract as well.

Moreover, techniques need to be optimized and rigorously tested in the

clinic to be adequately evaluated to have a pan-GI screening test. In

these researchers’ opinion, the diagnostic yield of these tests is

dependent on accurately predicting the mutations occurring earliest in

tumorigenesis, which may influence the transition between pre-malignant

lesions towards neoplasia.

An UpToDate review on “Tests for screening for colorectal cancer”

(Doubeni, 2024a) states that “Other stool-based tests may be available in

the future. In a phase 3 clinical trial among individuals 45 years and

older, a multitarget stool RNA (mt-sRNA) test has been found to have 94

% sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer, 46 % sensitivity for detecting

advanced adenomas, and 88 % specificity for no lesions on

colonoscopy”.

UpToDate reviews on “Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in

patients at average risk” (Doubeni, 2024b), and “Screening for colorectal

cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced

polyp” (Ramsey and Grady, 2024) do not mention stool RNA as a

management option.

Furthermore, National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s clinical practice

guidelines on “Colon Cancer” (Version 1.2024) and “Rectal Cancer”

(Version 1.2024) do not mention stool RNA as a management tool.

Drug-Coated Balloon for the Treatment of Colonic Strictures

Shen and Adorno-Garayo (2024) stated that intestinal strictures are

common AEs of chronic bowel conditions such as Crohn’s disease (CD),

diverticulitis, and ulcerative colitis (UC) or after intestinal surgery.

Mechanical endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) is the standard-of-care

(SOC) intervention, whereas multiple, repeat EBD therapy is often

needed. A novel drug-coated balloon (DCB) was developed to dilate

strictures while concurrently delivering medication to reduce the rate of

recurrence of strictures. These researchers presented the findings of a

first-in-human, observational, open-label clinical trial in small- and large-

bowel strictures. A total of 10 human adult subjects with chronic single,

discrete, and benign intestinal stricture were treated and followed for 2

years. Outcomes included the Endoscopic Obstructive Score (EOS),

Obstructive Symptom Score (OSS), and AEs. In this first-in-human trial

of benign small- and large-bowel strictures, subjects presented with a

mean stricture diameter of 10.3 mm, average EOS of 2.7, and OSS of

25.2. The technical success rate was 90 %, and no subjects had major

treatment-related AEs. EOS decreased to 0.2 on average at 6 months.

At 2 years, the retreatment-free survival rate was 100 %, and the average

OSS was 0.6; and the procedure was well-tolerated. The authors stated

that DCB treatment of benign small- and large-bowel strictures appeared

to be safe and showed durable results of decreased symptoms and

freedom from recurrence through 2 years. Moreover, these researchers

stated that these preliminary findings need to be validated in large-scale

clinical trials.

The authors stated that the drawbacks of this trial included the small

sample size (n = 10) and limited duration of study follow-up (2 years).

Other drawbacks may include the lack of a control group and lack of

diversity in the population cohort. Malignant strictures were also

excluded from this study. However, this was the 1st report of a paclitaxel-

coated balloon used to treat intestinal strictures. The POISE Trial was

designed as an early phase study to gain initial experience with the

device. Pilot studies such as this were usually carried out with a small

number of subjects to examine the early safety and effectiveness of the

investigational device before evaluating in a larger pivotal trial. Follow-up

will continue through the 5-year time-point for subjects enrolled in this

study. These researchers stated that a large RCT is planned to examine

the ProTractX3 DCB against standard EBD and will provide further insight

into the risks and benefits associated with this device.

Full-Spectrum Endoscopy (FUSE) Colonoscopy for Screening of

Colorectal Cancer

In a retrospective, single-center, feasibility study, Song et al (2016)

evaluated the full-spectrum endoscopy (FUSE) colonoscopy system in a

Korean population. These researchers examined the effectiveness of the

FUSE colonoscopy performed between February 1 and July 20, 2015. A

total of 262 subjects (age range of 22 to 80 years) underwent the FUSE

colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening, polyp surveillance, or

diagnostic evaluation. The cecal intubation success rate, the polyp

detection rate (PDR), the adenoma detection rate (ADR), and the

diverticulum detection rate (DDR), were calculated. Also, the success

rates of therapeutic interventions were evaluated with biopsy

confirmation. All patients completed the study and the success rates of

cecal and terminal ileal intubation were 100 % with the FUSE

colonoscope; these investigators found 313 polyps in 142 patients and

173 adenomas in 95. The overall PDR, ADR and DDR were 54.2 %, 36.3

%, and 25.2 %, respectively, and were higher in males, and increased

with age. The endoscopists and nurses involved considered that the full-

spectrum colonoscope improved navigation and orientation within the

colon. No colonoscopy was aborted because of colonoscope

malfunction. The authors concluded that the FUSE colonoscopy yielded

a higher PDR, ADR, DDR than did traditional colonoscopy, without

therapeutic failure or complications, showing feasible, effective, and safe

in this 1st Korean trial.

This study had several drawbacks: (i) as no other Korean center

currently employs the FUSE technology, this was a single-center,

retrospective, non-comparative and non-randomized study; (ii) these

researchers did not use a stop-watch to record time, but they did

check the time stamps on the videos taken during each colonoscopy.

As these researchers performed many therapeutic interventions,

even ESDs, mean total procedure time (18.3 ± 8.6 mins, range of 9 to

48 mins) was thus probably longer than those of other studies. But if

they considered only diagnostic interventions, mean total procedure

time was shortened to 12.7 ± 1.4 mins (range of 9 to 17 mins), (iii)

these investigators reported only the presence of a diverticulum, and

not the numbers thereof, because many cases had too many

diverticula to count, and (iv) the authors did not measure the exact

polyp size, and thus cannot compare among-study diﬀerences in the

PDR or ADR by the sizes of polyps or adenomas. Further larger

comparative studies are needed.

Leong et al (2017) noted that inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)

increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Surveillance colonoscopy with

chromoendoscopy is recommended, but conventional forward-viewing

colonoscopy (FVC) detects dysplasia with low levels of sensitivity. Full-

spectrum endoscopy (FUSE) incorporates 2 additional lateral cameras to

the forward camera of the colonoscope, allowing endoscopists to view

behind folds and in blind spots, which might increase dysplasia

detection. In a prospective, randomized, cross-over, tandem colonoscopy

study, these researchers compared FUSE versus FVC in the detection of

dysplasia in patients with IBDs. These investigators compared FVC

versus FUSE in 52 subjects with IBD undergoing surveillance for

neoplasia in Australia (23 with Crohn's colitis, 29 with ulcerative colitis;

median age of 45.0 years; 60 % men; mean IBD duration of 16.4 years).

All subjects met national IBD surveillance inclusion criteria; 27 were

assigned randomly to groups that underwent FVC followed by FUSE, and

25 were assigned to groups that underwent FUSE followed by FVC. All

procedures were performed from February 2014 through December

2015. Random biopsy specimens were collected and visible lesions were

collected; all were analyzed histologically. The primary end-point was

dysplasia missed by the 1st colonoscopy detected by the 2nd

colonoscopy. Dysplasia was diagnosed by an expert gastro-intestinal

(GI) pathologist blinded to the colonoscope allocation in consensus with a

2nd expert pathologist. FVC missed 71.4 % of dysplastic lesions per

lesion whereas FUSE missed 25.0 % per lesion (p = 0.0001); FVC

missed 75.0% of dysplastic lesions per subject and FUSE missed 25.0 %

per subject (p = 0.046). FUSE identified a mean of 0.37 dysplastic

lesions and FVC identified a mean of 0.13 dysplastic lesions (p = 0.044).

The total colonoscopy times were similar (21.2 mins for FUSE versus

19.1 mins for FVC; p = 0.32), but withdrawal time was significantly longer

for FUSE (15.8 mins) than for FVC (12.0 mins) (p = 0.03). Correcting for

per-unit withdrawal time, the mean dysplasia miss rate per subject was

significantly lower for FUSE (0.19) than for FVC (0.83; p < 0.0001).

Targeted tissue acquisition identified significantly more dysplastic lesions

than random biopsies (p < 0.0001). The authors concluded that i a

prospective cross-over study of IBD patients undergoing surveillance

colonoscopy, they found panoramic views obtained by full-spectrum

endoscopy increased the number of dysplastic lesions detected,

compared with conventional forward-viewing colonoscopy. This was a

small study examining surveillance for dysplasia in patients with

inflammatory bowel diseases.

Ratone et al (2017) stated that currently, colonoscopy and polypectomy

are the gold standard methods for the prevention of incident cases of

colorectal cancer. The use of a new colonoscope (Fuse, EndoChoice)

with a larger view of up to 330° appears to improve the ADR. In a pilot

study, these researchers performed a prospective observational study

concerning this scope. The primary end-point was potentially omitted

adenomas (POA), i.e., adenomas seen on the side screens that will not

appear on the central display during colonoscopy withdrawal without

oriented movements. Secondary end-points included ADR, Fuse impact

on ADR, time to cecal intubation and withdrawal time. These

investigators performed a single-center prospective study in 1 French

center. They enrolled patients over 18 years of age between January

2015 and March 2016. This study included 141 patients (78 men and 60

women; sex ratio 1.3); 3 were excluded because their colonoscopies

were incomplete. The mean age was 60.4 years. A total of 130 polyps

were resected. In all, 88/130 were adenomas (68 %) and 34/88

adenomas (39 %) were POA. The mean time to cecum was 10 mins, and

the mean withdrawal time was 12 mins; ADR was 35 % for men and 31 %

for women. The estimated ADR without POA was 29 % for men and 19

% for women. The authors concluded that the Fuse system appeared to

be safe and efficient; POA represented 39 % of all adenomas. The

impact of the panoramic view on the ADR was considered substantial.

This study had some limitations. First, was the possible subjectivity of the

primary end-point. Indeed, though operators described what they

considered to be PPOs during scope withdrawal, a certain diagnosis was

difficult. Nevertheless, a non-PPO polyp was also first seen on the side

screen and then on the central screen. Of course, the authors did not

consider this situation to resemble a PPO, because PPOs required

oriented movements to find them on a central screen, but subjectivity

remains. Other associated limitations were the lack of randomization or a

control group. Moreover, these researchers stated that recently, a high-

quality randomized study questioned the utility of Fuse in the detection of

adenomas in a population with a positive fecal immunochemical test: no

difference was demonstrated in ADR. This new result called into question

the superiority of the Fuse, suggested by the feasibility studies and

demonstrated by the tandem study of Gralnek et al. This very interesting

study encouraged further clinical research into this scope to examine if it

represents a minor or major improvement in CCR screening. Several

types of endoscopy center (expert or not) should be involved in future

randomized trials for “real-life” studies.

Bevan and Rutter (2018) stated that “Currently, RCT evidence for

colonoscopy screening is scarce. Although not yet corroborated by

RCTs, it is likely that colonoscopy is the best screening modality for an

individual. From a population perspective, organized programs are

superior to opportunistic screening. However, no nation can offer

organized population-wide colonoscopy screening. Thus, organized

programs using cheaper modalities, such as FS/FIT, can be tailored to

budget and capacity”.

UpToDate reviews on “Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in

patients at average risk” (Doubeni, 2018) and “Screening for colorectal

cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer” (Ramsey and

Grady, 2018) do not mention full spectrum endoscopy as a screening

tool.

Furthermore, National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s clinical practice

guideline on “Colon cancer” (Version 2.2018) and “Rectal cancer”

(Version 1.2018) do not mention full spectrum endoscopy as a screening

tool.

Guardant Shield Test for Colorectal Cancer

The Guardant Shield Test uses a multi-modal approach, integrating

genomics, epigenomics and proteomics, to detect CRC signals in the

bloodstream, including DNA that is shed by tumors, called circulating

tumor DNA (ctDNA). It demonstrated sensitivity of 91 % in CRC, and 20

% in advanced adenoma detection, with 92 % specificity (true negative

rate) in normal cases in validation studies. The Guardant Shield Test is a

laboratory developed test (LDT) that is intended to be complementary to

and not a replacement for current recommended CRC screening

methods.

Chung et al (2024) noted that CRC is the 3rd most diagnosed cancer in

adults in the U.S. Early detection could prevent more than 90 % of CRC-

related deaths, yet more than 1/3 of the screening-eligible population is

not up-to-date with screening despite multiple available tests. A blood-

based test has the potential to improve screening adherence, detect CRC

earlier, and reduce CRC-related mortality. These researchers examined

the performance characteristics of a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) blood-based

test in a population eligible for CRC screening. The co-primary outcomes

were sensitivity for CRC and specificity for advanced neoplasia (CRC or

advanced pre-cancerous lesions) relative to screening colonoscopy. The

secondary outcome was sensitivity to detect advanced pre-cancerous

lesions. The clinical validation cohort included 10,258 persons, 7,861 of

whom met eligibility criteria and were evaluable. A total of 83.1 % of the

participants with CRC detected by colonoscopy had a positive cfDNA test

and 16.9 % had a negative test, which indicated a sensitivity of the cfDNA

test for detection of CRC of 83.1 % (95 % CI: 72.2 to 90.3). Sensitivity for

stage I, II, or III CRC was 87.5 % (95 % CI: 75.3 to 94.1), and sensitivity

for advanced pre-cancerous lesions was 13.2 % (95 % CI: 11.3 to 15.3).

A total of 89.6 % of the participants without any advanced colorectal

neoplasia (CRC or advanced pre-cancerous lesions) identified on

colonoscopy had a negative cfDNA blood-based test, whereas 10.4 %

had a positive cfDNA blood-based test, which indicated a specificity for

any advanced neoplasia of 89.6 % (95 % CI: 88.8 to 90.3). Specificity for

negative colonoscopy (no CRC, advanced pre-cancerous lesions, or non-

advanced pre-cancerous lesions) was 89.9 % (95 % CI: 89.0 to 90.7).

The authors concluded that in an average-risk screening population, this

cfDNA blood-based test had 83 % sensitivity for CRC, 90 % specificity for

advanced neoplasia, and 13 % sensitivity for advanced pre-cancerous

lesions.

These researchers stated that participant adherence varies considerably

among the available CRC screening methods, with only 59 % of

screening-eligible individuals being up-to-date with screening and more

than 49 million un-screened individuals in the U.S. Estimates of

adherence to blood-based tests are higher than those reported for stool-

based tests or direct visualization tests. Blood-based testing offers an

additional option for CRC screening, in addition to the available stool-

based tests, and may improve screening participation and early detection

of CRC. These investigators stated that evaluation of participant

adherence to this cfDNA blood-based test in various clinical settings is

needed and is an area of active investigation, especially given that

participant adherence is affected by many factors beyond the test

availability. It is also important to highlight that a screening strategy that

uses non-invasive testing requires adherence to the screening test and to

the diagnostic colonoscopy in those with positive screening tests.

Ongoing studies that are examining the screening journey for participants

choosing this blood-based test will inform questions on participant follow-

up with diagnostic colonoscopy. Furthermore, future investigation that

entails health economic and outcomes modeling could inform the effect of

this blood-based test on CRC-related outcomes, especially the effect of a

test with high adherence and lower sensitivity for advanced pre-

cancerous lesions than stool-based testing, and could examine if the 3-

year interval of the blood-based test, proposed by the manufacturer for

screening, would yield beneficial clinical outcomes. The authors stated

that future studies to understand the effect of longitudinal testing on

sensitivity for advanced neoplasia warrant consideration. They noted that

in this study, the percentage of participants with an invalid cfDNA blood-

based test result was 3.7 % (298 of 8,159) and within the target range

(less than 5 %) proposed for programmatic FIT offering. Evaluating this

percentage in the real-world setting will be important to understand

population effect. Given the increasing incidence of CRC among

individuals younger than 45 years of age, understanding the potential

clinical and health economic effect of a blood-based testing strategy to

expand the screening age will be of interest.

Lei et al (2024) stated that CRC and gastric cancer (GC) rank the top 5

common and lethal cancers worldwide. Early detection can significantly

reduce the mortality of CRC and GC; however, current clinical screening

methods including invasive endoscopic techniques as well as non-

invasive fecal occult blood test screening tests/FIT have shown low

sensitivity or unsatisfactory patient's compliance. Aberrant DNA

methylation occurs frequently in tumorigenesis and cfDNA methylation

has shown the potential in multi-cancer detection. These researchers

examined the value of cfDNA methylation in the GI cancer detection and

developed a non-invasive method for CRC and GC detection. They

applied targeted methylation sequencing on a total of 407 plasma

samples from patients diagnosed with CRC, GC, and non-cancerous GI

benign diseases (Non-Ca). By analyzing the methylation profiles of 34

CRC, 62 GC and 107 Non-Ca plasma samples in the training set (n =

203), these investigators identified 40,110 GI cancer-specific markers,

and 63 tissue of origin (TOO) prediction markers. A new integrated model

composed of GI cancer detection and TOO prediction for 3 types of

classification of CRC, GC and Non-Ca patients was further developed via

logistic regression algorithm and validated in an independent validation

set (n = 103). The model achieved overall sensitivities of 83 % and 81.3

% at specificities of 81.5 % and 80 % for identifying GI cancers in the test

set and validation set, respectively. The detection sensitivities for GC and

CRC were 81.4 % and 83.3 % in the cohort of the test and validation sets,

respectively. Among these true positive cancer samples, further TOO

prediction showed accuracies of 95.8 and 95.8 % for GC patients, and

accuracies of 86.7 % and 93.3 % for CRC patients, in test set and

validation set, respectively. The authors concluded that they have carried

out comprehensive cfDNA methylation analysis and identified GI cancer-

specific methylation signatures and TOO prediction markers for CRC and

GC, showing that cfDNA methylation signature is a promising tool for the

early detection of GI cancers and non-invasive cancer screening.

Moreover, these researchers stated that it was worth noting that the

current model was tested in a clinical setting with patients showing

discomfort in digestive tract and the test’s potential application was

primary as an assistant diagnostic tool. For the test to further be applied

as a cost-effective screening tool, a future study entailing large-scale

validation based on high-risk population is needed.

Henriksen et al (2024) noted that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is

proposed as a tool for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment.

Digital PCR (dPCR) offers low analysis costs and turn-around times of

less than a day, making it ripe for clinical implementation. In an

observational study, these researchers employed tumor-informed dPCR

for ctDNA detection in a large CRC cohort to examine the potential for

post-operative risk assessment and serial monitoring, and how the

metastatic site may impact ctDNA detection. In addition, these

investigators examined how altering the ctDNA-calling algorithm could

customize performance for different clinical settings. Stage II to III CRC

patients (n = 851) treated with a curative intent were recruited. Based on

whole-exome sequencing (WES) on matched tumor and germline DNA, a

mutational target was selected for dPCR analysis. Plasma samples (8

ml) were collected within 60 days after operation and, for a patient subset

(n = 246), every 3 to 4 months for up to 36 months. Single-target dPCR

was used for ctDNA detection. Both post-operative and serial ctDNA

detection were prognostic of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 11.3, 95 %

CI: 7.8 to 16.4, p < 0.001; HR = 30.7, 95 % CI: 20.2 to 46.7, p < 0.001),

with a cumulative ctDNA detection rate of 87 % at the end of sample

collection in recurrence patients. The ctDNA growth rate was prognostic

of survival (HR = 2.6, 95 % CI: 1.5 to 4.4, p = 0.001). In recurrence

patients, post-operative ctDNA detection was challenging for lung

metastases (4/21 detected) and peritoneal metastases (2/10 detected).

By modifying the cut-off for calling a sample ctDNA positive, these

researchers were able to adjust the sensitivity and specificity of the test

for different clinical contexts. The authors concluded that these findings

from 851 stage II to III CRC patients showed that their personalized

dPCR approach effectively detected MRD after operation and revealed

promise for serial ctDNA detection for recurrence surveillance. The ability

to adjust sensitivity and specificity demonstrated exciting potential to

customize the ctDNA caller for specific clinical settings. These

investigators stated that while they await clinical utility to be demonstrated

in randomized clinical trials, these findings revealed an exciting potential

for improvement.

In a randomized study, Coronado et al (2024) examined if individuals who

had not completed a FIT for CRC screening would complete a blood-

based testing option if offered one during health encounters. Blood-

based screening tests for CRC could add to the total number of people

screened for CRC by providing another testing alternative. Study

participants were patients aged 45 to 75 years at a large, integrated

health system who were offered but did not complete an FIT in the

previous 3 to 9 months, and were scheduled for a clinical encounter.

Participants were randomized (1:1) to be offered a commercially available

CRC blood test (Shield, Guardant Health) versus usual care. These

investigators compared 3-month CRC screening proportions in the 2

groups. They randomized 2,026 patients; 2,004 remained eligible

following post-randomization exclusions (1,003 to usual care and 1,001 to

blood draw offer; mean age: of 60 years, 62 % women, 80 % non-

Hispanic white). Of the 1,001 allocated to the blood test group, 924 were

recruited following chart-review exclusions; 548 (59.3 %) were reached

via phone, of which 280 (51.1 %) scheduled an appointment with the

research team. CRC screening proportions were 17.5 percentage points

higher in the blood test group versus usual care (30.5 % versus 13.0 %;

OR 2.94, 95 % CI: 2.34 to 3.70; p < 0.001). The authors concluded that

among adults who had declined previous CRC screening, the offer of a

blood-based screening test boosted CRC screening by 17.5 percentage

points over usual care. Moreover, these researchers stated that further

investigation is needed on how to balance the favorable adherence with

lower advanced adenoma detection compared with other available tests.

Haynes et al. (2025) evaluated the real-world implementation of blood-

based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in two Appalachian primary

care clinics, a region with historically low CRC screening rates and high

CRC incidence and mortality. The study used a two-phase design: in

Phase 1, only standard-of-care (SOC) screening options (colonoscopy

and stool-based tests) were offered; in Phase 2, a blood-based test was

added as an option alongside SOC. Screening rates were measured over

two consecutive 3-month periods. The introduction of the blood-based

test led to a marked increase in overall CRC screening completion: 33 of

74 patients completed screening in Phase 1 (SOC only), compared to

151 of 165 in Phase 2 (SOC plus blood-based test). In Phase 2, the vast

majority of patients who completed screening chose the blood-based test

(134/151), indicating strong patient preference for this modality over

traditional options. The investigators concluded that this study

demonstrates that offering a blood-based CRC screening test in primary

care settings can substantially improve both screening uptake and

completion, particularly in populations with historically low adherence.

The study has several important drawbacks. First, the study was

conducted in only two primary care clinics in Appalachia, which limits

generalizability to other populations and healthcare settings. The sample

size was relatively small, and the short duration of each study phase

(three months) may not capture longer-term trends in screening behavior

or sustainability of increased uptake. Second, the study design did not

randomize patients to screening options, introducing potential selection

bias and confounding. The observed increase in screening rates may be

influenced by unmeasured differences between the two phases or by

temporal trends unrelated to the intervention. Third, the study focused on

screening uptake and patient preference, but did not assess clinical

outcomes such as detection rates of advanced adenomas or colorectal

cancer, nor did it report on follow-up colonoscopy completion after

positive blood-based tests. This is a critical limitation, as the effectiveness

of any screening program depends not only on initial test uptake but also

on the sensitivity for advanced neoplasia and adherence to diagnostic

follow-up. Fourth, as highlighted by the American Gastroenterological

Association, blood-based tests generally have lower sensitivity for

advanced adenomas than FIT or stool DNA tests, which may limit their

impact on colorectal cancer prevention even if uptake is higher. Finally,

the study did not address cost-effectiveness or health system resource

implications, which are important considerations for broader

implementation.

Measurements of Plasma GATA5 and SFRP2 Methylation as

Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer

Zhang and colleagues (2015) examined GATA5, SFRP2, and ITGA4

methylation in plasma DNA as non-invasive biomarkers for CRC or

adenomas. There were 57 CRC patients, 30 adenomas patients, and 47

control patients enrolled in this study. Methylation-specific PCR was used

to determine the promoter methylation status of GATA5, SFRP2, and

ITGA4 genes in plasma DNA, and their association with clinical outcome

in CRC. The predictive ability of GATA5, SFRP2, and ITGA4 methylation,

individually or in combination, to detect CRC or adenomas was further

analyzed. Hyper-methylated GATA5 was detected in plasma in 61.4 %

(35/57) of CRC cases, 43.33 % (13/30) of adenoma cases, and 21.28 %

(10/47) of control cases. The hyper-methylation of SFRP2 was detected

in 54.39 % (31/57), 40.00 % (12/30), and 27.66 % (13/47) in plasma

samples from CRC, adenomas, and controls, respectively. ITGA4

methylation was detected in 36.84 % (21/57) of plasma samples of CRC

patients and in 30.00 % (9/30) of plasma samples from patients with

colorectal adenomas, and the specificity of this individual biomarker was

80.85 % (9/47). Moreover, GATA5 methylation in the plasma was

significantly correlated with larger tumor size (p = 0.019), differentiation

status (p = 0.038), TNM stage (p = 0.008), and lymph node metastasis (p

= 0.008). SFRP2 and ITGA4 methylation in plasma significantly

correlated with differentiation status (SFRP2, p = 0.012; ITGA4, p =

0.007), TNM stage (SFRP2, p = 0.034; ITGA4, p = 0.021), and lymph

node metastasis (SFRP2, p = 0.034; ITGA4, p = 0.021). From the

perspective of predictive power and cost-performance, using GATA5 and

SFRP2 together as methylation markers seemed the most favorable

predictor for CRC (OR = 8.06; 95 % CI: 2.54 to 25.5; p < 0.01) and

adenomas (OR = 3.35; 95 % CI: 1.29 to 8.71; p = 0.012). The authors

concluded that a combination of GATA5 and SFRP2 methylation could be

promising as a marker for the detection and diagnosis of CRC and

adenomas.

Septin9

Septin9 (Sept9) DNA methylated assay for the early detection of

colorectal cancer (eg, Epi proColon, ColoVantage) is a plasma based test

that detects methylated Septin9 DNA, which is purportedly a marker of

the presence of colorectal cancer. It is designed for those who have

avoided established CRC screening methods such as colonoscopy,

FOBT or fecal immunochemical test (FIT). This test is not intended to

replace established CRC tests.

ColoVantage is a plasma-based test that detects circulating methylated

DNA from the SEPT9 gene which is involved in cytokinesis and cell cycle

control. According to the manufacturer, case-control studies show that

presence of methylated SEPT9 DNA in plasma is 58 % to 69 % sensitive

for CRC detection at a specificity of 86 % to 90 % (citing Lofton-Day et al,

2008; Grützmann et al, 2008; de Vos et al, 2009). The test is non-

invasive and requires no patient preparation. The manufacturer suggests

that a physician may order the test for screen-eligible patients who have

previously avoided established CRC screening methods such as

colonoscopy, FOBT, and fecal immunochemical tests. A patient whose

ColoVantage test result is positive may be at increased risk for CRC and

further evaluation should be considered. The manufacturer notes,

however, that the ColoVantage test has yet to be clinically validated as a

screening test. There are no evidence-based guidelines from leading

medical professional organizations or public health agencies that

recommend measurement of methylated Septin 9 in plasma for CRC

screening.

Molnar and colleagues (2015) noted that many countries have

implemented various CRC screening programs, but have not achieved

the desired compliance. Colonoscopy -- considered the gold standard for

CRC screening -- has its limitations as well as the other techniques used,

such as irrigoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, fecal blood and hemoglobin tests.

The biomarker septin 9 has been found to be hyper-methylated in nearly

100 % of tissue neoplasia specimens and detected in circulating DNA

fractions of CRC patients. A commercially available assay for septin 9

has been developed with moderate sensitivity (approximately 70 %) and

specificity (approximately 90 %) and a 2nd generation assay, Epi

proColon 2.0 (Epigenomics AG), shows increased sensitivity

(approximately 92 %). The performance of the assay proved to be

independent of tumor site and reaches a high sensitivity of 77 %, even in

early cancer stages (I and II). Furthermore, septin 9 was recently used in

follow-up studies for detection of early recurrence of CRC. The authors

evaluated the opportunities, known limitations and future perspectives of

®

the recently introduced Epi proColon( ) 2.0 test, which is based on the

detection of aberrantly methylated DNA of the v2 region of the septin 9

gene in plasma.

Jin and associates (2015) evaluated the performance of the Epi proColon

2.0 test for the detection of CRC, and compared it with FIT. A total of 135

patients with CRC, 169 with adenomatous polyps, 81 with hyperplastic

polyps, and 91 healthy controls were included. In all patients, peripheral

blood samples were taken for SEPT9 testing using Epi proColon 2.0 test.

For 177 patients, both SEPT9 and FIT were performed. The sensitivity

and specificity of SEPT9 for CRC were 74.8 % (95 % CI: 67.0 to 81.6 %)

and 87.4 % (versus non-CRC, 95 % CI: 83.5 to 90.6 %), respectively.

SEPT9 was positive in 66.7 % of stage I, 82.6 % of stage II, 84.1 % of

stage III, and 100 % of stage IV CRCs. The sensitivity of SEPT9 for

advanced adenomas was 27.4 % (95 % CI: 18.7 to 37.6%). The

sensitivity and specificity of FIT for CRC was 58.0 % (95 % CI: 46.1 to

69.2 %) and 82.4 % (95 % CI: 74.4 to 88.7 %), respectively. SEPT9

showed better performance in CRC detection than FIT, but similar among

advanced adenomas. The authors concluded that with improved

performance characteristics in detecting CRC, the 2nd-generation SEPT9

assay could play an important role in CRC screening and early detection.

Orntoft et al (2015) stated that the Sept9 DNA-methylation assay is

among the most well-studied blood-based screening markers. However,

earlier reported performances may be misleading: The Sept9 test was

recently examined in 2 screening based cohorts and yielded

performances lower than expected. These investigators hypothesized

that co-morbidities and/or demographic characteristics affect the results

of the Sept9 test. Using a retrospective nested case-control study design,

these researchers studied plasma from 150 cancer and 150 controls

selected from a well-characterized cohort of 4,698 subjects referred for

diagnostic colonoscopy due to CRC-related symptoms. The cases and

controls were matched on age and gender. Moreover, cases were

stratified on tumor-site and tumor-stage. The selected cohort included a

wide range of co-morbidities. Plasma Sept9 levels were assessed using

a commercially available PCR-based assay (Epi-proColon). Clinical

sensitivity for CRC stages I-IV was 37 %, 91 %, 77 %, and 89 %, and the

overall sensitivity 73 % (95 % CI: 64 to 80 %) and specificity 82 % (95 %

CI: 75 to 88 %), respectively. Age greater than 65 was associated with

both increased false positive and false negative results (p < 0.05).

Arthritis was associated with a higher false negative rate (p = 0.005)

whereas arterio-sclerosis was associated with a higher false positive rate

(p = 0.007). Diabetes was associated with Sept9 positivity with an odds

ratio (OR) of 5.2 (95 % CI: 1.4 to 19.1). When the performance of Sept9

was adjusted for these parameters in a final multivariate regression

model, the OR for a positive Sept9 test to be associated with CRC

increased from 8.25 (95 % CI: 4.83 to 14.09) to 29.46 (95 % CI: 12.58 to

69.02). The authors concluded that the findings of this study indicated

that the performance of the Sept9 assay is negatively affected by several

factors commonly associated with CRC screening populations: early-

stage disease, age greater than 65 years, diabetes, arthritis, and arterio-

sclerosis. This should be taken into account if the Sept9 assay is used as

a single marker for CRC screening, but may also have a wider impact, as

it is likely that such factors may affect other blood based DNA markers as

well.

On April 14, 2016, the FDA cleared Epi proColon (Epigenomics AG) as

the first blood-based screening test for CRC in average-risk patients who

choose not to be screened by colonoscopy or a stool-based FIT.

An UpToDate review on “Tests for screening for colorectal cancer: Stool

tests, radiologic imaging and endoscopy” (Doubeni, 2016) lists “Septin 9

hypermethylation in DNA from plasma (ColoVantage)” as an

investigational test. It states that “Current serum markers are not

sufficiently sensitive or specific to be used for screening. The potential to

utilize a combination of 6 serum markers to improve the test has been

reported in a feasibility study, but validation studies in screening

populations are needed before clinical relevance can be determined”.

The USPSTF (2016) stated that the FDA approved a blood

test, Epi proColon (Epigenomics) to detect circulating methylated SEPT9

DNA in April 2016.A single test characteristic study met the inclusion

criteria for the systematic evidence review supporting this

recommendation statement; it found the SEPT9 DNA test to have low

sensitivity (48%) for detecting colorectal cancer.

The ACS guidelines (Wolf et al, 2018) do not recommend the SEPT9

DNA test, based upon concerns about poor specificity compared with

recommended screening options and the limited base of evidence in

asymptomatic, screening populations. In addition, the ACS noted that

there has been no microsimulation modeling of the current version of the

test to estimate its benefit, a benefit-harm ratio, or a screening interval for

regular testing, which also has not been established by the manufacturer.

In addition, methylated Sept9 is a novel blood test for CRC early

detection with no comparable screening tests from which to infer a benefit

in terms of critical outcomes (CRC mortality or incidence reduction), as

there are for the included screening test options. The ACS guidelines

note that the test has not been cleared by the FDA for unrestricted use in

general routine screening.

SimpliPro Colon Test

The SimpliPro Colon Test (Applied Proteomics, Inc., San Diego, CA) is a

blood test that uses proprietary mass spectrometry platform and test

algorithm designed by Applied Proteomics to measure and analyze 11

protein markers in the blood that are associated with CRC and advanced

adenomas. This laboratory-based service is designed to enable better

compliance for diagnostic colonoscopy in patients presenting with

symptoms associated with CRC. It supposedly is the only blood test that

assesses risk for advanced adenoma in elevated-risk patients; however,

the SimpliPro Colon test has not been validated in an asymptomatic

screening population for CRC.

The American Cancer Society (2017) does not mention the SimpliPro

Currently, there is a lack of evidence reading the clinical benefit of the

Stool-Based Protein Biomarkers

Bosch and colleagues (2017) stated that the FIT for detecting hemoglobin

is used widely for non-invasive CRC screening, but its sensitivity leaves

room for improvement. In a case-control study, these researchers

identified novel protein biomarkers in stool that out-perform or

complement hemoglobin in detecting CRC and advanced adenomas. A

total of 315 stool samples from one series of 12 patients with CRC and 10

persons without colorectal neoplasia (control samples) and a second

series of 81 patients with CRC, 40 with advanced adenomas, and 43 with

non-advanced adenomas, as well as 129 persons without colorectal

neoplasia (control samples); 72 FIT samples from a third independent

series of 14 patients with CRC, 16 with advanced adenomas, and 18 with

non-advanced adenomas, as well as 24 persons without colorectal

neoplasia (control samples) were included in this analysis. Stool samples

were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Classification and regression tree

(CART) analysis and logistic regression analyses were performed to

identify protein combinations that differentiated CRC or advanced

adenoma from control samples. Antibody-based assays for 4 selected

proteins were carried out on FIT samples. In total, 834 human proteins

were identified, 29 of which were statistically significantly enriched in

CRC versus control stool samples in both series. Combinations of 4

proteins reached sensitivities of 80 % and 45 % for detecting CRC and

advanced adenomas, respectively, at 95 % specificity, which was higher

than that of hemoglobin alone (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively).

Selected proteins could be measured in small sample volumes used in

FIT-based screening programs and discriminated between CRC and

control samples (p < 0.001). The authors concluded that mass

spectrometry of stool samples identified novel candidate protein

biomarkers for CRC screening. Several protein combinations out-

performed hemoglobin in discriminating CRC or advanced adenoma from

control samples. They stated that this proof of concept study that such

proteins can be detected with antibody-based assays in small sample

volumes indicated the potential of these biomarkers to be applied in

population screening. A main limitation of this study was the lack of

availability of antibodies prohibited validation of the top protein

combinations in FIT samples.

The ColoCaller Test

Ma et al (2022) noted that because of poor compliance or low sensitivity,

existing diagnostic approaches are unable to provide an efficient

diagnosis of patients with CRC and gastric cancer. These researchers

developed the ColoCaller Test, which simultaneously detects the

methylation status of the SDC2, TFPI2, WIF1, and NDRG4 genes in stool

DNA, to optimize the screening of CRC and gastric cancer in high-risk

populations. A total of 217 stool samples from patients with GI cancer

and from patients with negative endoscopy were prospectively collected,

complete with pre-operative and post-operative clinical data from

patients. The methylation of these samples was detected using

ColoCaller, which was designed by selecting CpGs with a 2-step

screening strategy; and was interpreted using a prediction model built

using libSVM to examine its clinical value for CRC and gastric cancer

screening. Compared to pathological diagnosis, the sensitivity and

specificity of the ColoCaller test in 217 stool DNA samples were 95.56 %

and 91.86 %, respectively, for CRC, and 67.5 % and 97.81 %,

respectively, for gastric cancer. The detection limit was as low as 1 % in

8 ng of DNA. The authors developed and established a new test,

ColoCaller, which can be used as a screening tool or as an auxiliary

diagnostic approach in high-risk populations with CRC and gastric cancer

to promote timely diagnosis and treatment.

The authors stated that this is the 1st report on the use of methylated

SDC2, TFPI2, WIF1, and NDRG4 genes for early detection of gastric and

colorectal cancer (GCC), which not only retains the advantages of simple

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

and non-invasive characteristics similar to FOBT, but also higher

sensitivity and specificity to the screening or auxiliary diagnosis of a high-

risk population with GCC. At the same time, due to the convenient

sampling (home collection) and cheap costs ($100 to 300 per test), it can

be tested repeatedly in clinical application, which is conducive to

continuous monitoring. In the future, a screening method with stool

examination as the primary screening and endoscopy as confirmation will

be conducive to popularization and optimization of GCC screening to

further improve the detection rate of early gastric cancer and CRC. In

addition to being able to directly detect GCC, the ColoCaller test can

further stratify a high-risk population to improve endoscopy compliance;

and promote timely diagnosis and treatment. However, the sample size

used in this study to verify the performance of the ColoCaller test was

limited, and further investigation is still needed, especially due to the lack

of patients with advanced adenomas (AAs), furthermore, long-term

follow-up data are needed to support these findings. Furthermore, the

detailed clinicopathological characteristics of patients with GCC was not

included in this study, whether different disease sites or different

molecular subtypes, which may under-estimate the diagnostic

performance.

In a systematic review, Dolatkhah et al (2022) summarized test data and

carried out a meta-analysis, with respect to the multi-target stool DNA

(Mt-sDNA) test sensitivity and specificity, compared to colonoscopy. All

manuscripts were screened for eligibility according to inclusion criteria.

Participants were a normal population at an average risk of developing

CRC. Intervention was stool-based, and DNA panel tests compared with

colonoscopy, and outcome was detection of CRC and any pre-cancerous

lesions. Inter-study and inconsistency (using the I-squared test) were

assessed. Meta-analyses of the Mt-sDNA test showed a combined

sensitivity of 89 %, 51 %, and 76 % for the detection of CRC, AA, and

combined CRC and AA, respectively. The overall specificity was 91 %,

89 %, and 90 % for the detection of CRC, AA, and combined CRC and

AA, respectively. Mt-sDNA had significantly acceptable diagnostic

accuracy for CRC and AA diagnosis, but still has lower sensitivity and

specificity than colonoscopy.

Whole-Blood DNA Methylation Markers for Risk Stratiﬁcation in

Colorectal Cancer Screening

Raut and colleagues (2019) stated that DNA methylation profiles within

whole-blood samples have been reported to be associated with CRC

occurrence and might enable risk stratification for CRC. These

investigators systematically reviewed and summarized studies

addressing the association of whole-blood DNA methylation markers and

risk of developing CRC or its precursors. They searched PubMed and ISI

Web of Knowledge to identify relevant studies published until November

12, 2018. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study

population characteristics, candidate genes, methylation measurement

methods, methylation levels of patients in comparison to healthy controls,

p-values, and ORs of the markers. A total of 19 studies reporting 102

methylation markers for risk assessment of colorectal neoplasms met the

inclusion criteria. The studies mostly used methylation specific

polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) for assessing the methylation

status of a defined set of genes . Only 2 studies applied array-based

genome-wide assays to evaluate the methylation levels; 5 studies

incorporated panels consisting of 2 to 10 individual methylation markers

to examine their potential for stratifying the risk of developing colorectal

neoplasms. However, none of these associations was confirmed in an

independent cohort. The authors concluded that whole-blood DNA

methylation markers may be useful as biomarkers for risk stratification in

CRC screening, but reproducible risk prediction algorithms are yet to be

established by large scale epigenome-wide studies with thorough

validation of results in prospective study cohorts including large screening

populations. The possibilities of enhancing predictive power by

combining methylation data with polygenetic risk scores and

environmental risk factors need to be examined. The authors concluded

that there is considerable interest in the use of whole-blood DNA

methylation biomarkers to examine the likelihood of developing colorectal

neoplasms. However, current risk assessment studies are inconclusive

as to which methylation markers are promising for CRC risk stratification.

This is due to several limitations in methodology outlined in this study.

The variation in methodology and incomplete reporting among the studies

also limited the analyses of this review. It is, therefore strongly

recommended that future risk assessment studies apply more

standardized methods, particularly in quantifying methylation data.

10/25/25, 12:17 PM

Colonoscopy and Colorectal Cancer Screening - Medical Clinical Policy Bulletins | Aetna

Although time-consuming and expensive, diagnostic and risk stratification

performance should preferably be evaluated in screening cohorts or

large-scale population-based cohort studies rather than case-control

studies in which methylation patterns among cases may have been

altered through the course of the disease, after diagnosis or even initial

treatment. Integrating epigenetic and genetic markers may represent a

promising approach for future CRC risk stratification schemes. Thus,

further research should aim for assessment and validation of the

combined performance of genetic and epigenetic markers for CRC risk

prediction in order to best define the use of such signatures for research

and clinical practice.

The authors stated that this study had several drawbacks. First, these

researchers presented only a structured synthesis of multiple study

results. Due to the heterogeneity across the reviewed studies, they did

not perform a meta-analysis combining the results of independent

studies. Second, selection of studies may have affected the conclusions;

even after developing the inclusion/exclusion criteria to ensure that all

relevant studies were included, some articles could have been missed.

Finally, publication bias with a tendency to publish more promising results

may have led to over-estimated associations in this review.

Furthermore, UpToDate reviews on "Screening for colorectal cancer:

Strategies in patients at average risk" (Doubeni, 2021a), "Tests for

screening for colorectal cancer"(Doubeni, 2021b), and “Screening for

colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or

advanced polyp” (Ramsey and Grady, 2021) do not mention the use of

whole-blood DNA methylation markers as a management tool.
