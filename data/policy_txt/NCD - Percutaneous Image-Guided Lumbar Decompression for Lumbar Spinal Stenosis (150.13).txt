NCD - Percutaneous Image-Guided Lumbar Decompression for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (150.13)

PILD is a posterior decompression of the lumbar spine performed under indirect image

guidance without any direct visualization of the surgical area. This is a procedure proposed

as a treatment for symptomatic LSS unresponsive to conservative therapy. This procedure is

generally described as a non-invasive procedure using specially designed instruments to

percutaneously remove a portion of the lamina and debulk the ligamentum ﬂavum. The

procedure is performed under x-ray guidance (e.g., ﬂuoroscopic, CT) with the assistance of

contrast media to identify and monitor the compressed area via epiduragram.

Indications and Limitations of Coverage

B. Nationally Covered Indications

Effective for dates of service speciﬁed below, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services

(CMS) has determined that PILD will be covered by Medicare when provided in a clinical

study under section 1862(a)(1)(E)of the Social Security Act (the Act) through Coverage with

Evidence Development (CED) for beneﬁciaries with LSS who are enrolled in an approved clinical study that meets the criteria in section I or II below:

I. Effective for services performed on or after January 9, 2014, PILD will be covered by

Medicare through CED for beneﬁciaries with LSS who are enrolled in an approved clinical study that meets the following criteria. CMS has a particular interest in improved

beneﬁciary function and quality of life, speciﬁc characteristics that identify patients who

may beneﬁt from the procedure, and the duration of beneﬁt. A clinical study seeking Medicare payment for PILD for LSS must address one or more aspects of the following

questions in a prospective, randomized, controlled design using current validated and reliable measurement instruments and clinically appropriate comparator treatments,

including appropriate medical or surgical interventions or a sham controlled arm, for patients randomized to the non-PILD group.

The study protocol must specify a statistical analysis and a minimum length of patient follow up time that evaluates the effect of beneﬁciary characteristics on patient health

outcomes as well as the duration of beneﬁt.

i. Does PILD provide a clinically meaningful improvement of function and/or quality of

life in Medicare beneﬁciaries with LSS compared to other treatments?

ii. Does PILD provide clinically meaningful reduction in pain in Medicare beneﬁciaries

with LSS compared to other treatments?

iii. Does PILD affect the overall clinical management of LSS and decision making,

including use of other medical treatments or services, compared to other

treatments?

These studies must be designed so that the contribution of treatments in addition to the

procedure under study are either controlled for or analyzed in such a way as to determine their impact.

a. The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a particular

intervention potentially improves the participants’ health outcomes.

b. The research study is well supported by available scientiﬁc and medical information

or it is intended to clarify or establish the health outcomes of interventions already

in common clinical use.

c. The research study does not unjustiﬁably duplicate existing studies.

d. The research study design is appropriate to answer the research question being

asked in the study.

e. The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of

executing the proposed study successfully.

f. The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at 45 Code of Federal

Regulations (CFR) Part 46. If a study is regulated by the Food and Drug

Administration (FDA), it must be in compliance with 21 CFR parts 50 and 56.

g. All aspects of the research study are conducted according to appropriate standards

of scientiﬁc integrity (see http://www.icmje.org).

h. The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or incorporates by

reference, the standards listed here as Medicare requirements for CED coverage.

i. The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease

pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease

or condition being studied is life threatening as deﬁned in 21 CFR§312.81(a) and

the patient has no other viable treatment options.

j. The clinical research study is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website by the

principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the ﬁrst study subject.

k. The research study protocol speciﬁes the method and timing of public release of all

prespeciﬁed outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 24

months of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be published in a peer reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the

requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors

(http://www.icmje.org

).

l. The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in

clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must

discuss why these criteria are necessary.

m. The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are not

expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population to infer whether Medicare

patients may beneﬁt from the intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol

may be necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or Medicaid eligibility.

Consistent with section 1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and

Quality (AHRQ) supports clinical research studies that CMS determines meet the above- listed standards and address the above-listed research questions.

II. Effective for services performed on or after December 7, 2016, CMS will cover through a prospective, longitudinal study PILD procedures using an FDA-approved/cleared device

that completed a CMS-approved randomized control trial (RCT) that met the criteria listed in section I above. The CMS-approved prospective, longitudinal study must answer at least one of the following questions:

i. Does PILD provide a clinically meaningful improvement of function (e.g., reduced

acute and post-acute hospitalizations, nursing home care or inpatient rehabilitation services) and/or quality of life in Medicare beneﬁciaries with LSS compared to other treatments?

ii. Does PILD provide a clinically meaningful reduction in pain (e.g., as measured by

class, dose, duration of prescription pain medication use) in Medicare beneﬁciaries with LSS compared toother treatments?

iii. Does PILD affect the overall clinical management of LSS and decision making,

including use of other medical treatments or services (e.g., repeat PILD procedures, other interventions and surgical treatments), compared to other treatments?

The prospective, longitudinal study must also meet the following criteria:

1. The protocol must specify a statistical analysis and a minimum length of patient

follow-up time that evaluates the effect of beneﬁciary characteristics on patient health outcomes as well as the duration of the beneﬁt.

2. The eligibility requirements, both inclusion and exclusion criteria that were speciﬁed

in the CMS-approved RCT protocol, must be maintained in the new prospective, longitudinal study.

3. All study sites and study results must be listed in the ClinicalTrials.gov database. All CMS-approved clinical research studies must adhere to the following standards of

scientiﬁc integrity and relevance to the Medicare population:

a. The principal purpose of the study is to test whether the item or service

meaningfully improves health outcomes of affected beneﬁciaries who are represented by the enrolled subjects.

b. The rationale for the study is well supported by available scientiﬁc and medical

evidence.

c. The study results are not anticipated to unjustiﬁably duplicate existing knowledge.

d. The study design is methodologically appropriate and the anticipated number of

enrolled subjects is sufﬁcient to answer the research question(s) being asked in the National Coverage Determination.

e. The study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of completing it

successfully.

f. The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations

concerning the protection of human subjects found in the CFR at 45 CFR Part 46. If

a study is regulated by the FDA, it is also in compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56. In addition, to further enhance the protection of human subjects in studies conducted under CED, the study must provide and obtain meaningful informed consent from patients regarding the risks associated with the study items and/or

services, and the use and eventual disposition of the collected data.

g. All aspects of the study are conducted according to appropriate standards of

scientiﬁc integrity.

h. The study has a written protocol that clearly demonstrates adherence to the

standards listed here as Medicare requirements.

i. The study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Such studies may meet this requirement only if the disease or

condition being studied is life threatening as deﬁned in 21 CFR §312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.

j. The clinical research studies and registries are registered on the

www.ClinicalTrials.gov website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the

enrollment of the ﬁrst study subject. Registries are also registered in the AHRQ Registry of Patient Registries (RoPR).

k. The research study protocol speciﬁes the method and timing of public release of all

prespeciﬁed outcomes to be measured including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated early. The results must be made public within 12 months of the study’s primary completion date, which is the date the ﬁnal subject had ﬁnal data collection for the primary endpoint, even if the trial does not achieve

its primary aim. The results must include number started/completed, summary results for primary and secondary outcome measures, statistical analyses, and adverse events. Final results must be reported in a publicly accessibly manner; either in a peer-reviewed scientiﬁc journal (in print or on-line), in an on-line publicly

accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination of clinical trial information such as ClinicalTrials.gov, or in journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies with negative or incomplete results).

l. The study protocol must explicitly discuss beneﬁciary subpopulations affected by the item or service under investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said populations

in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative
