CG-DME-49 Standing Frames

Clinical UM Guideline

Subject: Standing Frames

Guideline #: CG-DME-49

Publish Date: 07/01/2025

Status: Reviewed

Last Review Date: 05/08/2025

Description

This document addresses the use of standing frames, which are assistive devices that provide an alternative position for individuals confined to supine, prone, or sitting positions. These devices allow the individual to achieve a standing position and then support the person in the standing position. Standers can be integrated to use with wheelchairs for those in a sitting position. Other types of standing frames are designed to aid individuals in a prone or supine position to achieve a standing position.

Clinical Indications

Medically Necessary:

A non-powered standing frame is considered medically necessary when a written assessment by a physician or other appropriate clinician demonstrates criteria 1, 2 and 3 are met:

1. The individual has a neuromuscular condition (such as multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury or

stroke) which impairs their ability to stand independently, but they are able to maintain a standing position due to residual strength in the hips, legs and lower body with the aid of a standing frame device; and

F e e d b a c k

2. The individual has completed appropriate standing device training and has demonstrated an ability to safely use

the device in the home setting; and

3. Use of the device can be reasonably expected to provide therapeutic benefits or enable the individual to perform

certain tasks that he or she is unable to undertake otherwise due to the neuromuscular condition.

Replacement of a non-powered standing frame is considered medically necessary when both of the following criteria have been met:

1. The medically necessary criteria above have been met; and 2. The device is out of warranty and cannot be refurbished or adequately repaired.

Not Medically Necessary:

A non-powered standing frame is considered not medically necessary when the criteria above are not met and for all other indications.

Replacement of a non-powered standing frame is considered not medically necessary when the criteria above have not been met.

A powered standing frame is considered not medically necessary.

Discussion/General Information

General Considerations

Impaired mobility is associated with multiple secondary complications including muscle wasting, decreased bone density, reduced skin integrity, spasms, constipation, depression, lowered self-esteem as well as an increased risk of mortality. Therapies such as passive standing have been used to improve motor function and minimize the detrimental effects of immobility, and to enhance hip alignment, bone mineralization, urinary function, respiratory functioning and psychosocial functioning.

A sit-to-stand device allows the individual with upper body strength to achieve a standing position from a sitting position without assistance. A sling is slipped behind the buttocks and hooked onto the frame of the standing device. The person’s legs and feet are placed in supports on the frame. The person lifts themselves to a standing position, either manually or by use of a motor. A back support is rotated in place to support the individual’s back.

A prone or supine stander is positioned next to the individual, usually next to a bed. The individual is either rolled or transferred to the device with the help of a sling lift. Once positioned on the device, the person’s extremities are secured, and the device is moved to a vertical (standing) position. These devices provide varying levels of support to the user which is dependent upon an individual’s level of head and trunk control.

Standing frames can be categorized by types:

Passive (static) stander: A passive stander remains in one place, sometimes has casters but cannot be self- propelled. Mobile (dynamic) stander: User can self-propel a mobile stander if they have upper body strength to push a manual wheelchair. Active stander: An active stander creates reciprocal movement of the arms and legs while standing. Powered Stander: A stander that includes a motorized, power operated component to assist in the transfer of an individual to and from the device or to allow for powered mobility once an individual is in the stander.

CG-DME-49 Standing Frames

Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

In a 2019 pragmatic, multicentre, superiority randomised controlled trial (RCT), Freeman and colleagues assessed the clinical effectiveness of a home-based, self-managed standing frame program. Individuals with MS and severe mobility impairment were randomly assigned to either a standing frame plus usual care group (n=71) or usual care only (n=69). The individuals in the intervention group were asked to use the standing frame for 30 minutes, 3 times/week for 20 weeks. These individuals had two home-based physiotherapy sessions, six follow-up phone calls and access to paper-based, DVD and online resources. Participants in the control group received no additional interventions. Motor function, as assessed by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA), was measured in all participants at baseline, at 20 weeks and at 36 weeks. The primary clinical outcome was set as the AMCA score at 36 weeks, and a 9-point AMCA change was considered clinically meaningful a priori. At 36 weeks post-randomisation, the AMCA score was significantly higher in the standing group compared to the usual care group with a between-group mean difference of 4.7 points. While motor function, as measured by the AMCA score, was significantly improved in the intervention group, the improvement did not reach the predetermined minimal clinically meaningful level of improvement. The positive results of this study suggest that modest improvement in one functional area is achievable.

Post-Stroke

In a pilot RCT, Allison and colleague (2007) studied 17 post-stroke individuals in a rehabilitation unit. Individuals were allocated to a control group (conventional physiotherapy) or a treatment group (conventional therapy plus an additional session of standing practice). Duration of study was variable depending upon the length of time the individual was inpatient, from 14 to 28 days. Balance, gross motor function and trunk control were assessed upon admission, weekly during the intervention stage and 12 weeks following discharge. At week 12, the treatment group reported a statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) in balance scores compared to the scores of the control group. The treatment group also reported an improvement in motor function scores over the control group, although that difference was not statistically significant. This small pilot study indicates that participants who received additional standing practice in addition to standard physiotherapy achieved higher median scores in motor function measures.

Cerebral palsy (CP)

A scoping review by McLean and associates (2023) focused on the potential benefits of supported standing interventions for children and young adults with non-ambulant cerebral palsy. The authors noted that supported standing is associated with improvements in bone mineral density (BMD), hip stability, and lower-limb range of motion (ROM), along with fostering psychosocial advantages such as enhanced social participation and reduced sedentary behavior. Although much of the evidence is rated as low quality, the body of evidence suggests positive impacts on physiological outcomes like postural alignment and muscle activity, and psychological outcomes such as health-related quality of life.

Hough and colleagues (2010) systematically reviewed the published literature addressing the efficacy of interventions, (for example, medical and physical) to improve low bone mineral density (LBMD) in children and adolescents with CP. Out of the eight studies included in the review, three studies included weight bearing interventions. The authors found that the most promising interventions for decreased BMD were weight bearing and bisphosphonates.

Caulton and colleagues (2004) studied severely disabled children with CP to determine whether participation in 50% longer periods of standing (in either upright or semi-prone standing frames) would lead to an increase in the vertebral and proximal tibial volumetric trabecular BMD (vTBMD), which affects low trauma fractures. A heterogeneous group of pre- pubertal children with CP (n=26) participated and were matched into pairs using baseline vertebral vTBMD standard deviation scores. Children within the pairs were randomly allocated to control (regular standing duration) or intervention (50% increase in the regular standing duration) groups. The median standing duration varied from 80.5% (range, 9.5%-102%) and 140.6% (range, 108.7%-152.2%) of the baseline standing duration in the control group and intervention group respectively. The mean vertebral vTBMD in the intervention group increased by 8.16 mg/cm3, a 6% mean increase in vertebral vTBMD. There was no change in the mean proximal tibial vTBMD. The authors found that a longer period of standing in non-ambulant children with CP improves vertebral, but not proximal tibial vTBMD. The authors concluded that such an intervention might reduce the risk of vertebral fractures, although it is unlikely to reduce the risk of lower limb fractures in children with CP.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)

Pedlow and associates (2019) conducted a Cochrane review in order to assess the positive and negative effects of standing devices and orthoses on musculoskeletal impairments and quality of life in individuals with DMD. The review planned to include RCTs and quasi RCTs. However, the authors did not identify any studies which met the inclusion

criteria. Based on insights from existing research on assisted standing therapy for other neurological conditions, the authors concluded:

Although there is a lack of conclusive evidence for the use of standing devices in DMD, clinical opinion and research from other neurological conditions (such as cerebral palsy), highlight the proposed benefits. These benefits include preservation of muscle length and range of joint movement via the stretch that occurs during standing (predominately of the hip and lower-limb muscles), delayed onset of scoliosis, increased bone density (thereby reducing the risk of fractures), fewer muscle spasms and better respiratory function (including voice control). Research on standing for other conditions has also suggested improved circulation, digestion, and bowel and bladder function…Standing devices are considered to be an essential component of the therapy management of DMD (both physiotherapy and occupational therapy).

In 2010, the DMD Care Considerations Working Group, a group of experts selected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a comprehensive set of management strategies for DMD. The report notes that passive standing devices in late ambulatory and early non-ambulatory stages are necessary when there are no or mild hip, knee or ankle contractures. In addition, the continued use of a passive device or a power device into the late non-ambulatory stage if the contractures are not too severe and devices are tolerated was advocated. This recommendation is based upon the collective judgment of the experts.

Additional Studies

There have been two systematic reviews assessing the available evidence and providing recommendations for supported standing programs. A 2010 systematic review by Glickman and colleagues included 39 studies, 10 pediatric and 29 adult studies. The majority of the studies were comprised of less than 50 participants and described or compared supported standing to another intervention or took measurements prior to and following the interventions. Studies were grouped based upon outcomes in BMD, cardiopulmonary function, muscle strength/function and ROM. The authors noted that for both pediatric and adult populations, the available evidence moderately supports standing programs in BMD, ROM, spasticity and bowel function. For those with spinal cord injuries, there was a potentially negative cardiopulmonary side effect. The authors noted that conclusions were difficult to reach as the literature varied greatly in terms of design, intervention and outcome measures. The authors recommended that practicing therapists should combine the results of this systematic review with sound clinical judgement based on supported stander usage rationale in their specific setting.

Paleg and colleagues (2013) addressed the use of standing support systems in the pediatric population. A total of 30 studies were reviewed, along with the authors’ opinions, to obtain recommendations for minimal dosages needed to maintain body function and structures. These areas included, but were not limited to, mental, cardiovascular and respiratory, digestive and urinary functioning and structures of the bones. The evidence was evaluated and recommendations made based upon the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) Levels of Evidence and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Levels of Evidence. Evidence levels range from the highest level (1: systematic review of randomized controlled trials) to lowest (5: expert opinion without critical appraisal). The authors noted that although none of the evidence was rated as level 1 evidence, the strongest available evidence-based literature supported the use of standing devices to positively affect BMD.

Standing frames are generally accepted as a standard of medical practice when used for individuals with neuromuscular conditions who have an impaired ability to stand independently. Powered standing frames are used primarily for the convenience of the individual or caregiver and have not been shown to provide additional clinical benefit.
