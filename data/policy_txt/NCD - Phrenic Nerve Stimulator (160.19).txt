Item/Service Description

The phrenic nerve stimulator provides electrical stimulation of the patient's phrenic nerve to contract the diaphragm rhythmically and produce breathing in patients who have

hypoventilation (a state in which an abnormally low amount of air enters the lungs). The device has been used successfully to treat hypoventilation caused by a variety of conditions, including respiratory paralysis resulting from lesions of the brain stem and cervical spinal

cord and chronic pulmonary disease with ventilatory insufﬁciency. The phrenic nerve

stimulator is intended to be an alternative to management of patients with respiratory

insufﬁciency who are dependent upon the usual therapy of intermittent or permanent use of

a mechanical ventilator as well as maintenance of a permanent tracheotomy stoma.

However, an implanted phrenic nerve stimulator can be effective only if the patient has an

intact phrenic nerve and diaphragm. Moreover, nerve injury may occur during the surgical

procedure and if sufﬁcient injury is incurred, the device will not prove useful to the patient.

Consequently, it is possible for such a device to be indicated for a patient but, due to injury

sustained during implant, fail to assist the patient, resulting in a return to the use of

mechanical ventilation.

Indications and Limitations of Coverage

The implantation of a phrenic nerve stimulator is covered for selected patients with partial or

complete respiratory insufﬁciency.
